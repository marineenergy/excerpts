    "text": "Excerpt\nAll of these species can sense sounds in the frequency range of the sound produced by the hydraulic drills. Sound levels typically decrease by ~40 dB at 100 m in water, i.e., a sound measured at 160 dB re 1 uPa at a distance of 1 m from the source will measure ~120 dB re 1 uPa 100 m away from the source. This is below the level that appears to affect any of the species listed here. Smith (2002) observed during construction activities involving drilling similar to those for the WET installation that marine life, turtles and fish in particular, were attracted to the activity, possibly by the bottom biota stirred up by the drilling. This suggests that the magnitude of the sound produced by the drills is not sufficient to alter behaviors of the species near the activity. Because of the short and intermittent nature of the noise produced by the drills during the construction phase of the project, it is unlikely that the noise will significantly disrupt feeding or other behaviors of these species. The noise produced by drilling during the construction phase of the project is localized, intermittent and of short duration. Although the species of interest for this assessment can sense sound of the magnitude and frequency content produced by the drills similar to those expected to be used for the installation operations, neither the amplitude nor the frequencies are sufficient to constitute an impact on the species. No mitigation measures are required during the construction and installation phases of the project.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003 – APPENDIX F: Wave Energy Technology (WET) Project Environmental Impacts of Selected Components.

In general, the workboats would be stationary or operate within a small area (e.g., during anchor mooring installation) or move methodically along a prescribed path (i.e., during the cable laying operation).

    "text": "Excerpt\nDuring operation, there is a potential for the WEC devices to experience an electrical fault or short due to damage to the transmission cables. In the event of an electrical fault, there is a short period of time during which the electrical current generated by the WEC system would leak to seawater. A computer-controlled fault detection and interruption system would divert the electric current from the cable and store it in load resistors in the event of a fault. Therefore, the Proposed Action is unlikely to significantly impact marine mammals due to electrical leakage during operation and maintenance activities. Decommissioning activities would not produce electrical leakage risks as there would be no electrical current running through the cables. Electroreception (i.e., the sensing of electric fields by organisms) is not found generally among mammals, including those that are most likely to be present in the project area. There is conflicting evidence for magnetoreception (i.e., the sensing of magnetic fields by organisms) or use of the Earth’s magnetic field in marine mammals (Klinowska 1985, 1988; Hui 1994; Brabyn and Frew 1994). But any evidence of marine mammals using geomagnetic information suggests that the information would be used at the landscape level instead of the bathymetric micro-feature level. Therefore, it is unlikely that electric or magnetic fields generated by the proposed subsea transmission cables during the operations and maintenance activities would significantly impact marine mammals.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nFrom the available information, it is impossible to confidently predict the magnetic emissions impact from the WEC undersea cable on the nearshore biota but it is likely that elasmobranchs, sea turtles and cetaceans can sense the cable’s magnetic field. There is little information regarding the threshold levels of sensitivity for these species. Based on background geomagnetic levels and the ability of several species to track geomagnetic features, their sensitivity is likely to be significant. Thus, there are four behavioral scenarios of impact assuming magnetic detection of the cables: 1) detection and no effect, 2) detection and confusion, 3) detection and avoidance or 4) attraction. The best means of mitigating the impacts of an electrical fault are to prevent it from happening. The strength of the WEC undersea power cable and its armored construction provide the first level of mitigation. If there is a fault, the computer-controlled electrical fault detection and circuit interruption system shunts the electrical current to the load resistors in from 6 to 20 ms, limiting the duration of the electrical field created by a fault.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003 – APPENDIX F: Wave Energy Technology (WET) Project Environmental Impacts of Selected Components.

Although the WEC cable is in contact with the seafloor, the thermal resistance of the sediments or other seafloor material is substantially higher than that of the seawater. Hence, the heat transferred directly into the seabed materials would be negligible. Heat released from the equipment canister, load resistors, and hydraulic fluid heat exchanger into the surrounding water is anticipated to be similar in nature to heat released from the undersea cable. The resulting temperature increase for a single buoy would be approximately 0.07 F (0.02 C).

Guidance for human diver exposure to underwater sound indicates that, in the 100 to 500 Hz frequency range, recreational divers (i.e., bareheaded) and swimmers should not be exposed to SPLs greater than 145 dB re 1 uPa (Parvin et al 2002). In the 501 to 2500 Hz frequency range, the same guidance recommends that recreational divers and swimmers should not be exposed to SPLs greater than 155 dB re 1 uPa. the construction period hand drilling associated with anchoring the subsea cables would be brief and temporary (i.e., approximately one week) and because the drill-related sound (i.e., assumed in the analysis to be 163 dB re 1 uPa at the source) would be attenuated to the lower guidance level approximately 50 ft (16 m) from the drilling, the construction related underwater noise is not expected to increase risk to humans in nearshore waters. Furthermore, according to MCB Hawaii Base Order P1710.1, all persons and watercraft are prohibited from recreational water sports and fishing within 500 yards of the shoreline in the approach areas at both ends of Runway 4-22.

The template will have dimensions similar to the bottom support frame and will be removed at the completion of foundation installation. The temporary increase in vessel traffic and associated mooring systems are expected to be minor and are consistent with activities already occurring in the area.

    "text": "Excerpt\nLaying the power cables on the sea floor, divers working to position and secure the cables, and anchors used by support vessels all have the potential to directly strike coral colonies should they be present when the equipment or divers contact the bottom. The severity of injury to the coral will depend largely on the size and hardness of the impacting object and the intensity of the impact. Injury could range from a small area of soft tissue damage that quickly heals to total obliteration of the colony. The project plan and BMPs require that divers be aware of the identity and status of the ESA proposed corals and to specifically watch for and avoid them completely during work to position and install the power cables, including anchoring support vessels. Based on the sparse distribution of these corals, the limited amount of work to be done where they occur, and the expectation that divers will comply with the BMPs, the Navy determined that the risk of direct impact on colonies of either species is discountable. During cable laying operations, diver and/or ROV assistance would be employed to avoid placement on ESA proposed listed corals. Installation of the WEC devices, mooring infrastructure, and scientific data gathering equipment would also avoid ESA proposed listed corals. During the operational period, there would be no collision hazard impacts to ESA proposed coral species from the operation or maintenance of the WEC devices, scientific data gathering equipment, and their associated infrastructure. Decommissioning activities would be coordinated with NOAA Fisheries to ensure the protection of ESA proposed listed coral.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nPower cables generate both electric and magnetic fields. The flow of seawater across the electric field of a power cable generates a weak magnetic field. Potential electric and magnetic fields surrounding the WEC undersea cable have been calculated for a range of electrical currents through the cable. Based on the anticipated current passing through the WEC cable, the electric field strength at the surface of the cable would range from approximately 1.5 to a maximum of 10.5 millivolts per meter (mV/m) and would decrease exponentially with distance from the cable. The magnetic field strength at the surface of the cable would range from approximately 0.1 amperes (amps [A]) per meter (A/m) to a maximum of 0.8 A/m and would decrease exponentially with distance from the cable. Organisms sensitive to magnetic fields may exhibit one of three behaviors: (1) detection and no effect, (2) detection and confusion or avoidance, or (3) attraction. Based on the available data as described in Chapter 4 and cited in Appendix F, impacts of electric and magnetic fields on marine organisms can be expected to range from no impact to avoidance of the vicinity of the WEC cable. Organisms sensitive to electric or magnetic fields may detect emissions near the WEC cable; however, the effects would be temporary. Since the cable occupies a small area of the seafloor, the impact of avoidance behavior would be minimal. The cable route would not occupy any unique feeding, breeding, birthing, or egg-laying areas. The analysis provided in Appendix F found no evidence in the literature of either short- or long-term effects of electric or magnetic fields from cables similar to the WEC cable on marine organisms, other than the possible behaviors described. Although there have been numerous inconclusive studies of the effects of electromagnetic fields on animals in air, no similar studies have been found of the effects of EMF on marine animals in seawater. During operation, the WEC system could possibly experience an electrical fault or short due to damage to the cable. In the event of an electrical fault, there is a short period of time during which the electrical current generated by the WEC system would leak to seawater. However, the computer-controlled electrical fault detection and circuit interruption system would shunt the electrical current to the load resistors within 6 to 20 milliseconds (ms), limiting the duration of the electrical field.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThe AMP is based on fish monitoring that was conducted in 2014 after the sockeye salmon smolt outmigration. During fish monitoring the largest school of fish detected in one observation was 100 fish and this was not during the sockeye smolt outmigration period. As the plan discusses, up to 20,000,000 outmigrating sockeye smolt could pass the RivGen in a single day during this concentrated period of outmigration and about 50,000,000 in the major two-week pulse of sockeye smolt outmigration at the project site. Project studies and reports do not consider the potential effects of fish alarm pheromones which can occur when the skin of even a single fish is injured and will release a fish alarm pheromone which is very quickly dispersed through the water causing a predator response in all other fish in a school. In salmonids, this results in fish sounding, i.e., they stop swimming and drop quickly to the bottom, which could result in a very large number of fish going through the turbines (Magurran, Irving and Henderson 1996; Sovava et al 2014; and Scott et al 2003). Video observations of a school of 100 fish cannot adequately inform the behavior of 20,000,000 fish in the same space and time.\nProject\nIgiugig\nDocument\nIgiugig Hydrokinetic Project NMFS Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations FERC Project No. 13511\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

In fact, as validated by the observation of the high rate of colonization of a discarded amphibious vehicle track, the anchor array will likely result in an overall increase in biotic composition and abundance in the areas where the anchoring system is situated. The anchor design should minimize or eliminate any movement of the anchor that could result in breakage of some of the corals and small ledges observed in the anchoring zone.

Trollers will motor near the buoys as they do the FADs and bottom fishers will either drift near the buoys, anchor near them, or tie off on them. The anchoring depth of the buoys at approximately 100 feet (30.5meters) is a diveable depth for most experienced scuba divers, especially commercial divers. They will dive primarily to spear the shallow water species around the anchoring systems, but may also use underwater surround nets and traps. Blue water divers are a unique subset of spear fishers who use high-powered spear guns at the State s FADs. They float in the water near the FADs and try to spear large pelagic game fish such as a’u (marlin), ahi (yellowfin tuna), and mahimahi (dolphin) that are attracted to the FADs. Blue water divers will also be attracted to the WEC buoys. The buoy cluster will be of interest to recreational scuba divers who will regard them as a unique dive site such as a cave dive or a wreck dive. They will want to dive on them just to see the buoys and observe them in action.

The pontoons are 4.6 feet in diameter, which represents a very small portion of the overall cross section of the river in the project area, and would not lead to a major increase of water speed. We expect scour around the project pontoons to be negligible. In addition, available information indicates that the majority of the riverbed is composed of coarse gravel, cobbles, and small to medium boulders, all of which require high river velocity for mobilization and are less prone to scour. The gravel, cobble, and boulders would also act as scour protection for any smaller sediment classes that may lie underneath.\nProject\nIgiugig\nDocument\nIgiugig Hydrokinetic Project Final License Application Environmental Assessment FERC Project No. 13511-003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The cable would cross an area of reef with sparse coral cover. The footprint of the cable will be approximately 12 in (30 cm) wide. Using diver assistance for portions of the cable route in waters up to 100 ft (30 m) deep and a cable route determined using ROV video surveys interpreted by marine biological experts for deeper waters, adjustments while laying the cables would allow for the footprint to be shifted away from any important invertebrate resources, such as coral colonies, to further avoid and minimize impacts. There may be adverse impact from diver presence while laying and securing the cable. Sand may be kicked up, or a coral colony accidentally damaged by a diver assisting the installation. Although the Proposed Action may have an unavoidable adverse effect to some coral colonies during construction, the overall impact will be minimal. The Proposed Action is expected to have minimal to no impact to other marine invertebrate communities, as the sandy substrate in the deep- water WETS berth area does not support a rich sessile invertebrate community.

Throughout 2006-2008, as discussed above, Verdant Power logged approximately 290 hours of bird observations before and during deployment of the RITE Demonstration Project KHPS units. Birds were observed around the demonstration project to determine if the KHPS units adversely impact diving birds associated with the East River; Verdant Power believes that the body of developed knowledge does not show any signs of impact on diving birds. This detailed effort in and around the RITE project demonstration site and the general area of the proposed RITE Pilot License did not show any material difference in pre-and post-operation bird activity. The presence of more geese flying through the area in post-deployment during the fall of 2008 can be attributed to seasonal migration patterns. Observations during the operation of the RITE Demonstration KHPS units also did not indicate any increased attraction of diving birds to the site which may have been expected if the turbines impacted fish in the area. Anecdotal evidence suggests double-crested cormorants, the only diving birds observed at the site, swim/float with the current and only dive during or close to slack tide when the turbines are not rotating.\nProject\nRITE\nDocument\nRITE Final License Application FERC Project No. 12611, Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The species that could occur in the project area are species that are relatively insensitive to noise (i.e. humpback whales, bottlenose dolphins, and spinner dolphins). The rock drill will be used in the presence of people and operating equipment and vessels. The physical cues of people and equipment are likely to discourage marine mammals from approaching the drill closely. The rock drills would be used for short, punctuated periods of time–several minutes at a time–instead for a sustained period of time. Furthermore, protective zones would be implemented during drilling operations to ensure that no harassment occurs to marine mammals (see BMPs listed in Section 2.2.4 and below). Rock drilling operations would not commence if a marine mammal is sighted within 1,640 ft (500 m) of the drilling site. If a marine mammal enters the zone after drilling has started, operations would cease if the animal approaches within 820 ft (250 m) of the drilling site (i.e., outside the estimated 120 dB re 1 Pa isopleth of 141 m described in previous paragraph).\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The cables would be secured to the seafloor in water depths less than 100 ft (30 m), to avoid movement due to the high energy wave and surf zone. Beyond 100 ft (30 m), the lower wave energy at the seafloor and weight of the cables would keep them relatively stationary. Based on marine surveys conducted between the installation of the shallow-water WET berth transmission cable in 2003 and 2011, there was no evidence that any portion of the existing transmission cable had moved since being installed in 2003 and no evidence that any corals had been damaged due to movement of the cable (see discussion in Section 3.7.3). Therefore, the same is expected for the Proposed Action’s subsea cables in corresponding water depths and habitat zones.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

This determination is based on analyses of (1) wave height reduction due to wave scattering and (2) wave height reduction due to energy absorption. Using a numerical solution to evaluate wave scattering caused by a wave passing through an infinite grating of circular cylinders, results indicate that the effects of six WEC buoys on wave transmission and reflection would be negligible. This is due to the relatively large design spacing between the buoy cylinders, 169 ft (51.5 m), as compared to the buoy diameter of 15 ft (4.5 m). Potential effects on wave heights due to energy absorption were analyzed by running a wave refraction-diffraction model. Results estimated that wave heights near the shoreline would be reduced by 0.5 percent for a wave period of 9 s, and less than 0.3 percent for a period of 15 s. The impact of six WEC buoys on a wave field would be minimal and would not be noticeable or quantifiable given the randomness of the wave action.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

During high wave activity, a WEC device might have a SPL of up to 151 dB re: 1 uPa at 1 m, but the sound will occur amidst ambient wave noise, which will mask the sound to some degree. For a WEC device that has a SPL of 151 dB re 1 uPa at 1 m, the 120 dB re 1 uPa isopleth would lie at 115 ft (35 m) from the source, using spherical spreading loss. Under conditions of high ambient noise, the WEC device may be difficult to detect acoustically at distances greater than the 120 dB isopleth. Any behavioral disturbance, such as avoidance of the area, would occur at less than 115 ft (35 m) from the device. Due to the nature of the sound, its similarity to light vessel traffic, and its association with wave noise, exposed animals are expected to habituate to the sound which would make any behavioral modification or avoidance temporary.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThree components of the Reedsport Project represent sources of EMF: the PowerBuoys, the USP, and the subsea transmission cable. In conclusion, the Faraday cages of the PowerBuoy and USP and the metallic sheathing and burying of the project subsea cables will significantly reduce or eliminate E fields from being emitted into the surrounding aquatic environment. Magnetic (B) fields cannot be shielded, and the flow of seawater or organisms through a B field creates a weak electric field (iE field). OPT\n\nhas found no evidence to indicate that magnetic fields negatively affect marine life (Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies 2005; Scott Wilson Ltd. and Downie 2003; Sound & Sea 2002; USACE 2004; Scottish Executive 2007; World Health Organization 2005). However, resource agency staff are concerned that the project differs from traditional sources of anthropogenic EMF in the ocean (underwater power cables). Specifically, agency staff note that instead of a single cable lying on or under the seabed, the proposed project represents 10 PowerBuoys and associated cables running through the entire water column, as well as the multiple cables running along the seabed, converging on the USP. Therefore, instead of a single linear source of EMF, as represented by the subsea cable running from the USP to shore, the proposed project represents a matrix of cables and PowerBuoys spanning the water column and converging on the seabed in the PowerBuoy array area. Resource agencies believe that the potential effects of this unique EMF-generating array should be evaluated in situ and potential effects to identified marine life examined. OPT believes that the proposed EMF Study Plan will allow for the collection of necessary information to evaluate the B fields generated by the project and to confirm that the corresponding E fields are negligible, as anticipated. Comparison of the recorded EMF levels to known thresholds for sensitive species will allow for a determination of potential effects, if any, of EMF emitted by the project. Where threshold levels are not available in the literature for species of concern or other surrogates, the Aquatic Resources and Water Quality Committee will be convened to determine appropriate steps through the AMP to understand the effects of the EMF on these species. Also, as part of the Fish and Invertebrates Study, OPT will evaluate if the project affects the local (scale: tens of meters) distribution and abundance of adult Dungeness crab (Appendix C).\n\nProject\nOPT Reedsport\nDocument\nOPT Reedsport Wave Park FERC Project No. 12713 Applicant Prepared Environmental Assessment\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Historically, problems with entanglement were due primarily to the lack of technology available to precisely place and secure a cable or control the amount of tension. This resulted in spanning or bridging of the cable, and loops developing over time. In contrast to the these early systems, the WEC undersea cable would have the following characteristics: Installation would occur in shallow water (i.e., depths to approximately 100 ft [30.5 m]). Installation would occur with adequate tension to allow the cable to contour to the seafloor without suspensions or forming loops. Divers would inspect the cable route once it is placed. The length of the cable is relatively short compared to trans-oceanic undersea cables, about 3,900 ft (1,190 m).\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Because both turbine noise and ambient noise vary in time, the description is probabilistic. The time distribution of turbine noise is derived from measurements of a similar tidal turbine and convolved with the time distribution of ambient noise in the proposed project area. Results suggest that characterizing turbine noise and studying marine mammal responsiveness at this location will be challenging due to existing ambient noise associated with high vessel traffic density and sediment transport.

The noise levels associated with use of an impact hammer during construction pile driving activities may cause avoidance behavior. However, construction will be conducted outside the short migration window for Atlantic salmon smolts. As noted previously, Atlantic sturgeon have never been reported in Cobscook Bay so it is anticipated the given the short duration of the Project, expected noise levels near or below ambient levels (except for use of impact hammer) would not adversely affect Atlantic sturgeon in the extremely rare event they might occur in or near the Deployment Area.\nProject\nCobscook Bay\nDocument\nORPC Cobscook Bay FERC Pilot License Application – Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

While ORPC anticipates that adult and juvenile Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon will be able to detect and avoid the TidGenTM device, specifically the turbines, ORPC does not expect the Project will deter these species from otherwise using or transiting the habitat in an area where marine species are already exposed to a variety of commercial uses. The very limited number of adult Atlantic salmon returns and rapid migration through the Bay further minimize risk of effect to this species. ORPC will be conducting post-monitoring studies that can be used to more fully evaluate this potential affect.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThe magnitude of the proposed projects for Western Passage/Harris Cove and Lower Cobscook Bay/Deep Cove are sufficiently small in scope that little impact to benthic habitats and their associated communities is anticipated. Such impacts will be predominantly temporary and of short duration, although longer-term (project duration) impacts or habitat losses may occur in the footprint area directly beneath the moorings. Benthic impacts in the turbine deployment areas will result almost entirely from habitat loss within the footprint of the moorings and, although this loss will continue as long as the moorings are deployed, the loss may be offset by the additional surface area afforded by the three-dimensional structure of the moorings; there may even be a net gain in benthic habitat. Additionally, the already limited habitat loss could be further minimized through design features of the base of the moorings that would allow flow beneath the mooring.\n\nBurial of the cable, regardless of method, will result in disturbance to the seafloor sediments and associated benthic communities, but such disturbance will be temporary and generally of very short duration. No threatened or endangered species were found during the survey, all organisms encountered being common and generally ubiquitous within the region, therefore, any small impacts to the benthic community resulting from specific aspects of the project, e.g. installation of moorings or burial of the cable, will likely be quickly mitigated through replacement or recruitment from the surrounding community.\nFinally, when the limited impacts anticipated with the proposed project are viewed in the context of the other surrounding activities, specifically commercial drag fishing and aquaculture, it is likely that the project-related impacts will be indiscernible from the impacts associated with these other activities.\n\nProject\nCobscook Bay\nDocument\nORPC Cobscook Bay FERC Pilot License Application – Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

These BMPs are in no way intended to supersede or replace measures required by any other authorization or agency including, but not limited to the US Army Corps of Engineers, US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Environmental Protection Agency, or other NMFS divisions. Compliance with these BMPs is secondary to safety concerns. • Work window restrictions: All survey activities are restricted to daylight hours only and during weather conditions that allows visual siting of marine mammals. • Instrument operating procedures: Playback studies must be limited to 6 hours in duration, not to exceed 161 dB re 1μPa at 1 meter. A playback episode must be discontinued if an animal exhibits repetitive strong adverse reactions to the playback activity or the vessel. The sound source must be shut down if a non-target species is observed in the action area. Upon shutdown, the applicant must use a ramp-up protocol of 3 dB per minute to resume full playback signal levels. • Implementation of a safety exclusion zone for non-target species: For Killer Whales in Washington State inland waters—If a Killer Whale is seen, Researchers must maintain a distance of at least 183 meters (200 yards) and may not intercept a whale or position a vessel in its path. • Visual monitoring program: Marine Mammal Observers (MMOs) will be on duty during all playback treatments, in order to determine that no Killer Whale or Humpback Whale enter the 183-meter safety zone around the vessel. The MMOs will inform the researchers aboard the survey vessel if animals appear likely to enter the zone, and shut-down procedures will be initiated if the animals enter the zone. MMOs will work four-hour shifts, with a break between shifts. • Instrument shut-down procedures: Shut-down of playback instruments and all vessel maneuvering activity will cease at the initiation of the MMO, if a Killer Whale or Humpback Whale moves into the 183-meter safety exclusion zone. The MMO will inform the researchers and potentially harmful activity will cease until the animals have cleared the zone and are observed by the MMO to be moving away from the survey site.

For this study, a single cross-flow turbine would be installed in the gantry and the AMP sensors expanded to include a broader suite of active acoustics, including multibeam sonars, split-beam echosounders, and single-beam echosounders. The minimum operating frequency of these sonars will be 30 kHz. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the capability of range of sensors to identify collisions between fish and turbines, using inert targets as a proxy for fish. Testing would involve simple “cooperative targets” (for example, a plastic shell instrumented with a pressure gauge and accelerometer). Initial tests would involve deploying these targets in close proximity to a stationary or motored (i.e., motor-driven) turbine to establish baseline sensor performance in the absence of energetic inflow. To evaluate sensor performance under more realistic conditions, cooperative targets would be deployed upstream of the vessel and intentionally targeted for turbine collision. All targets will be recovered at the conclusion of testing using a buoyancy engine (either a compressed air bladder or solid piston to change the cooperative target buoyancy from neutral to positive).\nProject\nAMP - Lake Washington\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 2\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nEffects of the Action Fish Species The potential risk to ESA-listed fish species posed by these tests is collision with the turbine. However, because turbine testing will only take place during USACE work windows, when ESA-listed fish species are unlikely to be present in the action area, there is no pathway for effect. Similarly, because the vessel will not disturb the lake bed, there is no pathway to affect their critical habitat. Further, fish are likely to be alerted to the presence of the testing vessel by the acoustic emissions from its propulsion system and disperse in advance of passage. Cross-flow turbines of this type have been demonstrated to pose little risk to aquatic species. Viehman and Zydlewski (2015) analyzed acoustic camera observations of fish interacting with a larger-scale cross-flow turbine. They observed fish entering, avoiding, passing, or pausing in the wake of the turbine. They were not able to observe collision within the rotor swept area due to the positioning of the acoustic cameras. Hammar et al. (2013) evaluated fish interactions with a turbine of similar size to the one proposed for testing here (1.5 m height, 0.7 m in diameter, 3 helical blades). Their study utilized stereo-optical cameras in tropical water during daylight hours, such that they were able to track fish through the rotor. No collisions between fish and the turbine were observed and only two individual fish passed through the rotor swept area, though several hundred fish were observed around the turbine, primarily during low currents. During both types of testing, R/V Russel Light will be equipped with an Adaptable Monitoring Package (AMP). The optical and acoustic cameras will continuously observe the turbines and the acoustic camera will trigger data archiving if any targets are detected in the field of view (cooperative targets deployed by the vessel crew or opportunistic non-ESA fish species). The existing suite of algorithms have been previously demonstrated to detect fish schools, diving birds, seals, and kelp with high accuracy (Cotter et al. 2017). We have determined that the proposed project will have No Effect on ESA-listed fish species identified above. As testing will occur from a boat, the proposed project will have No Effect on designated critical habitats for these species.\nProject\nAMP - Lake Washington\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 2\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nLake Washington is within the range of the marbled murrelet (Desimone 2016). Because marbled murrelet forage for prey beneath the water surface, there is a potential pathway for effect through collision with the turbine. However, population densities at this location are extremely low. As of 2016, there was a single reported breeding occurrence of a marbled murrelet in southern Lake Washington in the WDFW Wildlife Survey Data Management Corporate data base (Desimone 2016). Population density in the action area is sufficiently low that Lake Washington is not included in annual population surveys and the nearest population survey sites have a reported density of &lt; 1 bird/km2 (Flaxa et al. 2008). Given this population density and a maximum of 12 hours of turbine run time on the lake, the likelihood of a random encounter with a diving marbled murrelet is discountably low. Further, given observations of fish behavior around a similar type of turbine (e.g., Hammar et al. 2013), testing would not be expected to create a foraging attractor. Marbled murrelet prefer dense, shady old growth forests, of which this habitat criteria does not occur within or near the project site (Desimone 2016). The closest known critical habitat area is over 30 miles east of the action area. As testing will only occur in Lake Washington, there is no pathway to affect the marbled murrelet’s critical habitat. Lake Washington is also within the range of the streaked horned lark, though is not a location with a known population (closest known population is in southern Puget Sound, USFWS 2016). The streaked horned lark uses flat, sparsely vegetated sites dominated by grasses and forbs, including native prairies, coastal dunes, fallow and active agricultural fields, wetland mudflats, sparsely-vegetated edges of grass fields, recently planted Christmas tree farms with extensive bare ground, moderately- to heavily-grazed pastures, gravel roads, or gravel shoulders of lightly-traveled roads (Stinson 2016). Large open areas are not present within the project area or adjacent to it. Given that the species does not forage beneath the water surface, the likelihood of encounter between a streaked horned lark and a turbine is unlikely. We have determined that the proposed project will have No Effect on ESA-listed avian species identified above. As there is no critical habitat within the project area, the proposed project will have No Effect on designated critical habitats for these species.\nProject\nAMP - Lake Washington\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 2\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The general operation of Tanana River Test Site and the deployment of a mechanical debris detection system and active acoustics specifically are the subject of a continuing dialog with state agencies and permitting actions: On June 9, 2009, AHERC received authorization from the US Corps of Engineers via a letter of permission, file # POA-2009-1261, to place an anchor, mooring buoy and floating platform in the Tanana River. On May 29, 2012, AHERC received a letter of permission authorizing the addition of a floating surface debris diverter to the AHERC equipment. In November 2009, AHERC obtained a title 16 habitat permit from the Alaska Department of fish and Game for the placement of a river bank founded floating research platform in the Tanana River. In subsequent years the permit was amended to allow the placement of mid channel anchors, mooring buoys, multiple floating research platforms and hydrokinetic generators. In January 2010, AHERC was issued a State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources Land Use Permit for the use of state shorelands for hydrokinetic research.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThe environmental stresses associated with the collection of inflow and wake data are: Sound produced by acoustic Doppler current profiler, velocimeters, split beam sonar or imaging sonar; Entanglement or collision with sounding weights, lines, sonar heads, or debris detection splines Noise associated with small boat operations. None of these are likely to significantly affect aquatic species. Installation and removal of the Manson anchors will disturb the cobble and gravel pavement of the riverbed over a relatively small area (approx. 0.25 m3 per anchor). Given that the cobbles are scoured clean by the currents, the small disturbance to the riverbed should be imperceptible to aquatic species. The acoustic Doppler current profiler operates at a frequency of 1.2 MHz and the acoustic Doppler velocimeters operate at a frequency of 6 MHz whereas the split beam sonar operates at 120 kHz and the imaging sonar at either 900 or 2.250 MHz. These frequencies are several orders of magnitude higher than the auditory thresholds of any fish (Hastings and Popper 2005Doppler, split beam and imaging type sonar instruments are commercially available and in common usage by researchers, consultancies, and federal agencies throughout US waters. The line between the pontoon research platform and the ADV sounding weight will be held taut by the currents for the duration of their deployment. Consequently, the risk of entanglement by birds or fish is likely negligible. While collision with the sounding weight supporting the acoustic Doppler velocimeters is possible, the streamlined form factor will result in an upstream “bow wake” that will naturally advect aquatic species around the weight if approaching from the upstream direction. Migration from the downstream direction occurs primarily along the edges of the river for energetic reasons. Deployment and recovery of the velocity sensors will require the use of river jon boats, which will temporarily elevate underwater noise levels, but not to an intensity that would be expected cause harm to aquatic species present in the project area.\nProject\nTanana - AK\nDocument\n2015_2_5_Tanana River Biological Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nTesting in a Benign Environment Environmental stresses associated with testing of the AMP in a benign environment include: The disturbance of the lake bottom where the docking station is set down (less than 1 m2 of disturbed area on each of up to six occasions), The presence of a research vessel in Lake Washington (up to 48 hours in total on six occasions), and The presence of the AMP and ROV deployment system in the water column of Lake Washington (up to 48 hours in total on six occasions) or alongside the University of Washington dock adjacent to the ship canal (up to 30 hours in total on five occasions). The disturbance of the lake bottom associated with setting down the docking station will be minimal, restricted to less than one square meter of disturbed area where the ballasted frame makes contact. This will result in a short-term, localized increase in turbidity that is unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species. The deployment and recovery of the AMP is an amalgam of operations associated with launching and recovering an ROV and deploying and recovering a small instrumentation package. The AMP supports a number of passive and active acoustic instruments, as well as a strobe-illuminated camera system, but these will not be powered on during testing and the AMP presence is unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species. The ROV is an inspection-class system equipped with cameras and artificial lighting. This model of ROV is similar to those used for benthic habitat and fisheries surveys by state and federal resource agencies (e.g., Packunski et al. 2008) and is unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species. The umbilical between the launch platform and surface vessel will the taut and the umbilical between the ROV and launch platform will be moderately taut. The tension in these umbilicals and short-term nature of the deployment minimizes the risk of marine life becoming entangled (or a net becoming entangled around an umbilical). Consequently, neither the umbilicals, nor the launch platform, are likely to have an effect on ESA-listed species.\nProject\nAMP - WA\nDocument\nAMP Biological Evaluation REV1.02\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nTesting in an Adverse Environment Environmental stresses associated with testing of the AMP in an adverse environment are similar to those resulting from testing in a benign environment. The differences, in addition to the environment in which the testing occurs, are: Disturbance of a cobble and gravel seabed, rather than a muddy lake bottom Shorter duration of testing activities When the docking station is set down, its weight will likely displace cobbles and crush those sessile invertebrates that are in direct contact with the frame. This includes a number of non-ESA listed barnacles, starfish, sponges, and anemones. Recolonization of disturbed areas (&lt; 3 m2 in total) would likely occur within twelve months. The limited extent of the disturbance in a homogeneous benthic habitat suggests that these disturbances are unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species. Because of the extensive commercial vessel traffic in Admiralty Inlet (quantified by Bassett et al. 2012), the presence of one sixty-foot research vessel is unlikely to have any incremental effect on ESA-listed species.\nProject\nAMP - WA\nDocument\nAMP Biological Evaluation REV1.02\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nBest Management Practices (BMPs) for General In-Water Work Including Boat and Diver Operations\n\nThe following BMPSs are intended to reduce potential adverse effects on protected marine species. These BMPs are in no way intended to supersede or replace measures required by any other agency including, but not limited to the ACOE, USFWS, USEPA, or NMFS. Compliance with these BMPs is secondary to safety concerns.\nA. Constant vigilance shall be kept for the presence of ESA-listed marine species during all aspects of the proposed action, particularly in-water activities such as boat operations, diving, and deployment of anchors and mooring lines.\nThe project manager shall designate an appropriate number of competent observers to survey the marine areas adjacent to the proposed action for ESA-listed marine species. Surveys shall be made prior to the start of work each day, and prior to resumption of work following any break of more than one half hour. Periodic additional surveys throughout the work day are strongly recommended. All in-water work shall be postponed or halted when ESA-listed marine species are within 50 yards of the proposed work, and shall only begin/resume after the animals have voluntarily departed the area. If ESA-listed marine species are noticed within 50 yards after work has already begun, that work may continue only if, in the best judgment of the project supervisor, that there is no way for the activity to adversely affect the animal(s). For example; divers performing surveys or underwater work would likely be permissible, whereas operation of heavy equipment is likely not. When piloting vessels, vessel operators shall alter course to remain at least 100 yards from whales, and at least 50 yards from other marine mammals and sea turtles. Reduce vessel speed to 10 knots or less when piloting vessels at or within the ranges described above from marine mammals and sea turtles. Operators shall be particularly vigilant to watch for turtles at or near the surface in areas of known or suspected turtle activity, and if practicable, reduce vessel speed to 5 knots or less. If despite efforts to maintain the distances and speeds described above, a marine mammal or turtle approaches the vessel, put the engine in neutral until the animal is at least 50 feet away, and then slowly move away to the prescribed distance. Marine mammals and sea turtles should not be encircled or trapped between multiple vessels or between vessels and the shore. Do not attempt to feed, touch, ride, or otherwise intentionally interact with any ESA-listed marine species.\n\nNo contamination of the marine environment should result from project-related activities.\n\nA contingency plan to control toxic materials is required. Appropriate materials to contain and clean potential spills will be stored at the work site, and be readily available. All project-related materials and equipment placed in the water will be free of pollutants. The project manager and heavy equipment operators will perform daily pre-work equipment inspections for cleanliness and leaks. All heavy equipment operations will be postponed or halted should a leak be detected, and will not proceed until the leak is repaired and equipment cleaned. Fueling of land-based vehicles and equipment should take place at least 50 feet away from the water, preferably over an impervious surface. Fueling of vessels should be done at approved fueling facilities. Turbidity and siltation from project-related work should be minimized and contained through the appropriate use of effective silt containment devices and the curtailment of work during adverse tidal and weather conditions. A plan will be developed to prevent debris and other wastes from entering or remaining in the marine environment during the project.\n\nProject\nAMP - WA\nDocument\nAMP Biological Evaluation REV1.02\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Post a dedicated lookout to assist the vessel operator in monitoring the location of all marine mammals. Avoid sudden changes in speed and direction.\n1 mile to ½ mile away: Reduce speed to 10 knots.\n½ mile or less: Reduce speed to 7 knots. Maneuver to avoid head-on approach.\nCLOSE APPROACH PROCEDURE: 600 feet or closer: Parallel the course and speed of moving whales up to the designated speed limit within that distance. Do not attempt a head-on approach to whales. Approach and leave stationary whales at no more than idle or “no wake” speed, not to exceed 7 knots. Do not intentionally drift down on whales.\nSTAND-BY ZONE 300 feet to 600 feet away: Two vessel limit within the 300- to 600-foot Stand-By Zone at any one time.\nCLOSE APPROACH ZONE 100 feet to 300 feet away: One vessel limit.\nNO INTENTIONAL APPROACH WITHIN 100 FEET. Do not approach within 100 feet of whales. If whales approach within 100 feet of your vessel, put engines in neutral and do not re-engage propulsion until whales are observed clear of harm’s way from your vessel.\nDEPARTURE PROCEDURE All vessels should leave the whales following the same speed and distance procedures described above.

    "text": "Excerpt\nEnvironmental Baseline Conditions The Yakutat coastal region is home to a suite of subarctic marine birds, mammals and fish. All five species of Pacific salmon are present in the proposed survey area as well as steelhead salmon and dolly varden. Resident benthic species likely to occur within the proposed survey area include Pacific Halibut and weathervane scallop as well as numerous other bivalves (e.g. BOEM, 1997). Listed seabird species that may inhabit the project area include Kittlitz’s murrelets (Brachyramphus brevirostris). Though their center of activity appears to be Yakutat Bay, northwest of the project area (Schoen et al., 2013). Aleutian and Arctic terns also breed in the region and Common Murres frequent the project area as well (Alaska Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm. 2016). Numerous other bird species utilize or reside in the project region as well (e.g. BOEM, 1997) Marine mammal species known to occur here include fin, humpback, gray, minke, sperm and killer whales, in addition to harbor and Dall’s porpoises. Additionally, there was a sighting of four North Pacific right whales in 1979, one of very few sightings of this species outside of the Bering Sea (Shelden et al. 2005). The closest pinniped haul outs have been identified for harbor seals approximately 8 miles south from the area of interest for the development of the WEC, at Blacksand spit and at the north side of Ocean cape, in Yakutat Bay (NMML unpublished data). Aerial surveys for Steller sea lions have been conducted about bi-annually since 1990, also being focused on a limited spring-summer window (NMML, unpublished data). The nearest Steller sea lion haul-outs consist of just a few animals, one site just east of the Dangerous River (~28 nm from the project site) and another on the outer coast west across Yakutat Bay (~25 nm). Annual surveys conducted from March to April since 2000 have counted between 722 and 1950 animals hauled out on sandbars in the Akwe and Alsek rivers during the eulachon run (Catterson 2005). No tracking studies of pinnipeds have been implemented in the project area, but harbor seals tagged in Glacier Bay took extensive migrations along the coast adjacent to and through the project area (Womble 2012). Though utilization of the nearshore area by the Yakutat Forelands (i.e. the proposed project area) was low – which is expected based on the seals’ distant natal site – the area was used throughout the year for transiting and possibly foraging. Though harbor seals are considered philopatric, adults commonly undertake movements of 50-100 km (26-52 nm) and occasionally up to 200 km (104 nm) from their natal area, especially outside the breeding and molting periods (i.e, during fall and winter; Boveng et al. 2012). In their first year of life, young harbor seals commonly undertake trips of &gt;75 km (39 nm), ranging as far as &gt;300 km from their natal area (Small et al. 2005). A joint NPS-NMFS study of harbor seal movements and haul-out behavior in Disenchantment and Icy Bays is planned for FY15 and FY16. Aerial surveys for sea otters in Yakutat Bay have occurred every 5-10 years since 1987 with the latest occurring in 2005 (Gill and Burn 2007). Surveys occur from April to August. Since surveys began the population is believed to be increasing from a low of fewer than 400 to the current level of about 1,600. Over this time, the population has also expanded its range within Yakutat Bay to both the eastern and western shoreline (Fig. 1) in areas shallower than about 40 meters. Otter densities on the outer coast from Cape Yakataga to Cape Spencer (encompassing the project area) are very low with an estimate of only 32 animals (USFWS, 2013). Sea otters are generally not considered migratory, ranging at most 10’s of kilometers, and have relatively small home ranges (&lt; 24 km2). The specific location for this proposed project does not seem to be in close range of pinniped haul outs or cetacean hot spots, however the temporary presence of multiple marine mammal species is highly probable. There are no data to describe the seasonality of the different marine mammals observed in this area, aerial surveys typically occur in summer (NMML cetacean surveys occurred in June/July and pinnipeds surveys in August) and flights covering the Yakutat region are made as quickly as in one or two days. However, some coastal species observed in this area are migratory and cross the Gulf of Alaska twice every year on their migration to northern feeding grounds in spring and southern breeding grounds in fall (Perrin et al. 2008). Coastal species such as humpback whales and gray whales likely cross the proposed project area during their migration. Other coastal marine mammals with high probability of being present in the project area are killer whales, harbor porpoises, belugas, harbor seals and Steller sea lions. Killer whales have been tagged with satellite transmitters in 2010 and have been tracked passing by the project area and entering Yakutat Bay (Hanson et al., 2012). Harbor porpoises are commonly seen in shallow waters both inside and outside Yakutat Bay (Hobbs and Waite, 2010). Opportunistic beluga sightings have been reported around Khantaak Island, near Ocean cape in Yakutat Bay, indicating that they could access the project site. Finally, the Northeastern GOA coast appears to be a hot spot for strandings of pelagic and deep water species, including beaked whales and sperm whales.\nProject\nYakutat - AK\nDocument\nkasper_alfa_nepa_yakutat_biological_evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

None of these are likely to significantly affect aquatic species. The MBES operates either at 200 or 400 kHz, dependent on water depth, and the imaging sonar at either 900 or 2.250 MHz. These frequencies are outside the range of the auditory thresholds of any fish and marine mammal species (e.g. Hastings and Popper 2005) . Multibeam echosounders and imaging type sonar instruments are commercially available and in common usage by researchers, consultancies, and federal agencies throughout US waters. MBES and imaging sonar surveys will require the use of a ~10 m survey boat equipped with dual outboard engines, which will temporarily elevate underwater noise levels, but not to an intensity that would be expected cause harm to aquatic species present in the project area.\nProject\nYakutat - AK\nDocument\nkasper_alfa_nepa_yakutat_biological_evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Vertebrate species listed under the ESA may include intraspecific taxa described as Distinct Population Segments (DPS), some of which have been described by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESU). Designated Critical Habitat (DCH) for the following species occurs in or near the project area: Coho salmon - On February 11, 2008, NMFS listed the Oregon coast coho salmon ESU as threatened and DCH. Critical habitat for Oregon coast coho salmon includes riverine and estuarine areas within 80 occupied watersheds in 13 associated sub-basins. Critical habitat for coho salmon includes the waters of Yaquina Bay, but does not extend out to the offshore waters of PMEC-SETS project area. Green sturgeon - In October 2009, NMFS designated all nearshore waters to a depth of 60 fathoms (360 feet or 110 meters) offshore Oregon as critical habitat for the southern DPS of the green sturgeon (ICF 2012). As such, the green sturgeon DCH includes the PMEC-SETS project areas. Leatherback sea turtle - Critical habitat for the leatherback sea turtle was previously designated only in the Atlantic Ocean (44 FR 17710), but on January 26, 2012, NMFS designated critical habitat in the Pacific Ocean off areas of Washington, Oregon, and California (77 FR 4170). The area designated includes the offshore waters between Cape Flattery, Washington, and Cape Blanco, Oregon, out to the 2,000-meter depth contour and an similar area offshore California (ICF 2012). As such, the leatherback sea turtle DCH occurs within the PMEC- SETS project area. The Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) manages four groups of fish along the West Coast of the United States under federal Fishery Management Plans (FMPs): groundfish; salmon; highly migratory species; and coastal pelagic species. The groundfish FMP includes more than 80 species of fish and the salmon FMP includes all species of salmon occurring along the west coast of the United States that are commercially fished. The highly migratory species FMP includes the tunas, some shark species and billfish. The coastal pelagic FMP includes five taxa: northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax); market squid (Loligo opalescens); Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax); Pacific (chub) mackerel (Scomber japonicas); and jack mackerel (Trachus summetricus). As required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, EFH has been designated for each of these groups except highly migratory species, and all waters within and adjoining the PMEC- SETS project areas constitute EFH. Specifically, EFH has been designated as follows (Pacific Fisheries Management Council 2010):\nGroundfish - Water depths less than or equal to 11,483 feet (3,500 meters) to the mean higher high water level or the upriver extent of saltwater intrusion, defined as upstream and landward to where ocean-derived salts measure less than 0.5 parts per thousand during the period of average annual low flow; seamounts in depths greater than 11,483 feet (3,500 meters) as mapped in the EFH assessment geographic information service (GIS) data; areas designated as habitat areas of particular concern not already identified by the above criteria. Salmon - All waters of the United States between the Canadian border and the Mexican border and out 200 miles (370 kilometers) to the western extent of the Exclusive Economic Zone. Pelagic - All waters of the United States from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and out 200 miles (370 kilometers) to the western extent of the Exclusive Economic Zone.\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Phytoplankton are comprised of simple free‐floating uni- and multi-cellular organisms like cyano-bacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, silicoflagellates, and coccolithophorids. Sessile algae, commonly termed seaweeds, include many species of large brown and red algae. Sessile algae occur in rocky intertidal and sub-tidal areas of the coast within the photic zone (water depths to which sunlight can penetrate). The largest such algae include several species of brown kelp, that along the Oregon coast consist almost exclusively of bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana), which grows sub-tidally. This species has special legal status because of its value as a commercial raw material and habitat for protected fish species (ICF 2012). No hard or rocky substrate is known to occur within the vast majority of the PMEC-SETS project site; however, a small amount of rocky reef exists in a narrow area in approximately 40 meters (131 feet) of water off Yaquina Head. Bull kelp was not observed on this rocky area during videographic surveys in 2010, likely because water depths (i.e., lack of sufficient light) preclude the growth of any bull kelp (ICF 2012).\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nZooplankton, Crab Larvae and Fish Larvae The zooplankton community inhabiting offshore central Oregon consists of small invertebrate organisms that either spend their entire life cycle in the water column (holozooplankton) or spend only a brief developmental time in the water column before a metamorphosis to an adult life in a nektonic or benthic habitat (merozooplankton). Species composition changes and is influenced by various periodic and episodic factors including prevailing ocean currents, coastal upwelling, and offshore wind direction. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describe the coastal zooplankton community inhabiting central Oregon as being dominated by copepods (Keister and Peterson 2003). In total, fifty-eight copepod species are reported being present in these waters, of which eight occur throughout the year, seven occur only during the summer, and six occur only in the winter. Species composition is seasonally dependent. Overall biomass population and individual species abundance are typically lower in the winter than in the summer months. During the summer months, when the offshore winds blow predominantly from the northwest, surface waters move southward and offshore due to Ekman drift, allowing the colder, more saline, and nutrient‐rich waters from deeper water depths to upwell along the coast. Between January and May, the megalopae larvae of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) are abundant inshore. Three species assemblages of fish larvae have been described as inhabiting the coastal waters of Oregon: coastal, transitional, and offshore. The coastal assemblage occurring in the PMEC-SETS project area is typically dominated by smelts (Osmeridae), which account for 50% of the population, and English sole (Parophrys vetulus), sandlance (Ammodytes hexapterus), sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus), starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus), and Pacific tomcod (Microgadus proximus). The highest fish larvae abundance is reported to occur between February and July (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001). Auth et al. (2007) reported northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis), rockfish (Sebastes spp.), northern lampfish (Stenobrachius leucopsarus), and blue lanternfish (Tarletonebeania crenulairs) as the dominant taxa along the Newport hydrographic line (43° 39’N) (ICF 2012).\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nBenthic Invertebrates Benthic invertebrate communities inhabiting the nearshore marine environment provide important secondary production in marine food webs and are integral to the breakdown and recycling of organic material in the marine ecosystem. They also provide a key food source for important commercial and recreational fish and macroinvertebrate species like Dungeness crab, as well as for other protected or managed fish species. In 2010 and 2011, the HMSC conducted surveys in and around PMEC-NETS, a site several miles to north of PMEC-SETS, to document the presence of a number of demersal fishes and benthic invertebrate species. Although this research was not conducted to identify species at the PMEC-SETS, a review of the observations may provide insight as to species presence and abundance within the SETS. Benthic habitats at and near the PMEC-NETS were characterized by Henkel (2011), reporting results of box cores, trawls, and videography performed on 10 occasions between May 2010 and December 2011. Six sampling stations were located within the NETS study area; three sampling stations were located outside of the site to the north and three stations were located outside of the site to the south (between the project site and the north Newport jetty), at water depths of 30 to 50 meters. Sample frequencies and sizes were designed to be large enough to detect potential changes in the future. Principal findings from monitoring at NETS included (Henkel 2011): Two distinct sediment types: silty sand at approximately 30 meters, and potentially shallower; and nearly pure sand at 40 meters and deeper. Distinct infaunal invertebrate assemblages occur in the two sediment types. Distinct infaunal invertebrate assemblages occur north and south of Yaquina Head at the deeper stations. Mysid and Crangonid shrimp are highly abundant and likely form the basis of the food web in this nearshore zone, as opposed to the krill‐supported food web further offshore. Videography observations are more effective than trawls for sampling large invertebrate species such as crabs, sea stars, and sea pens.\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nFish The nearshore and offshore regions of the Yaquina Head area encompass both rocky and soft bottom sub-tidal habitats and the open water pelagic environment. This area, therefore, supports a variety of fish species that typically inhabit all three habitats with frequent movement of fish between them. Typical fish species that inhabit these areas are discussed below. Although very little hard bottom substrate is known to be present in the project areas, natural sub-tidal reefs closer inshore at Yaquina Head support pelagic and benthic fish communities that associate with rocky, rather than soft, substrate. Fish species commonly observed in sandy bottom areas offshore Yaquina Head include English sole (Parophrys vetulus), butter sole (Isopsetta isolepis), Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus), speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus), and starry flounder (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011; Henkel 2011). Sampling by Henkel (2011) found that the fish assemblage varies with season. High densities of flatfish characterized the catch in summer, and speckled sanddab were usually the dominant species. In October, flatfish densities were significantly lower but prickle breast poachers (Stellerina xyosterna) were abundant. In February, a variety of smelt (Osmerus spp.) were in higher abundances. Rocky sub-tidal, or hard bottom, habitats typically experience a wide variety of wave and current regimes, substrate, depths, and food sources, producing diverse biological communities (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife 2006). The rocky reefs off Newport provide important habitat for fish species that include sculpins (Cottidae), surf perch (Embiotocidae), and rocky reef fishes. Shallow reefs up to 20 meters (66 feet) in depth are dominated by black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), while deeper reefs are dominated by lingcod (Ophiodon elongates), black‐and‐yellow rockfish (Sebastes chrysomelas), and black rockfish (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011). Although these areas of rocky sub-tidal habitat are located outside the PMEC-SETS project area, juvenile lingcod and rockfish would likely use pelagic and soft bottom habitats, and older mature fish typically associated with rocky sub-tidal habitats could be found swimming in the deeper soft bottom regions. As a consequence, these taxa might be present in the vicinity of the project. A number of environmental factors affect the fish species present in the pelagic zone, including light penetration, water temperature, proximity to river plumes, and underwater currents. Pelagic species commonly found in the area include Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), northern anchovy, and Pacific Ocean perch (Sebastes alutus). The area is also utilized by salmon, steelhead, and shad that migrate alongshore; including those stocks that migrate through the Yaquina Bay estuary to spawn upriver (ICF 2012) and any of the species listed in Table 3.\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The most common year‐round inhabitants are the pinnipeds: Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). Male California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are occasionally observed foraging in southern and central Oregon coastal areas but are not regular inhabitants. Cetaceans potentially present in the project areas include transient killer whales (Orcinus orca), which appear along the Oregon coast in April, in conjunction with the California gray whales’ northward migration. Killer whales of the southern resident group occasionally pass by during migrations from their principal range in Washington and British Columbia, en route to foraging grounds off central California, where they seasonally feed on migrating Chinook salmon (Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2007). Other whales observed offshore of the Oregon coast include blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), finback whale (Balaenoptera physatus), sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis), Pacific right whale (Balaena glacialis japonica), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and sperm whale (Physeter catodon). California gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) occur along the central Oregon coast throughout the year with a small population of resident whales present between May and October. Migrating gray whales occur between March and June on their northward migration, and between December and March on their southward migration. Ortega‐Ortiz and Mate (2008) report that in 2008, gray whales were observed offshore of Yaquina Head transiting the area during both southward and northward migrations. Gray whales migrated southward through the area beginning in mid‐January, with the peak of the migration occurring in late January. Northbound migrating gray whales were observed as early as late February, with the peak migration occurring between late March and mid‐April. Ortega‐Ortiz and Mate (2008) further reported observing gray whale movements predominantly occurring in parts of the ocean where water depths are between 10 and 70 meters (33 and 230 feet)\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nSound from Active Acoustic Sensors and Instruments Marine Fishes As discussed under the effects of dockside testing, all active acoustic sensors on the iAMP and sources on cooperate targets operate at frequencies above fish hearing and would not be audible. Avian Species Maximum sensitivity to avian species for airborne sound is between 1 and 5 kHz (Dooling 1982), so it is unlikely that any of the active acoustics would be audible to brown pelicans. Marine Mammals While marine mammal hearing is more sensitive to higher frequencies, hearing thresholds for pinnipeds and cetaceans do not exceed 200 kHz (Johnson 1967, Szymanksi et al. 1999, Kastelein et al. 2009, Kastelein et al. 2002). This is below the operating frequency of the acoustic camera (2250 kHz), multibeam sonar (500 kHz), and acoustic Doppler current profiler (500 kHz). Consequently, none of these instruments are likely to be audible to marine mammals in the project area. The operating frequency of the fish tags used in cooperative target testing (69 kHz) is within the hearing range of pinnipeds, mid-frequency cetaceans, and high-frequency cetaceans that may be present in the project area. Given that these sources will be deployed in a limited manner (up to eight hours in total, with a signal repetition rate of no more than once per minute), no biologically significant behavioral response to the sound would be expected. The intensity of the impulsive sound transmitted by the fish tag is also below the statutory limit for acoustic harassment of marine mammals (150 dBrms re 1 µPa source level versus 160 dBrms re 1 µPa limit for Level B harassment). Presence of iAMP Platform Given the deployment depth of the iAMP and application of anti-fouling coatings to the hull and structure, not significant fouling of the platform would be expected during testing. Consequently, biologically significant reef effects within critical habitat would not be expected. The deployment of the iAMP would disturb less than 0.25 m3 of sandy seabed. Because gently sloping sandy bottom habitat is abundant off the Oregon coast, the temporary placement of the small iAMP platform is unlikely to have biologically significant effects. Presence of Vessels Installation and recovery of the autonomous iAMP will involve operations from the R/V Elakha, a 54’ research vessel equipped with an A-frame and deck crane. The R/V Elakha would be present on two occasions for less than 10 hours in each instance for iAMP deployment, cooperative target testing, and recovery. Given the limited duration of these activities and the relatively high levels of commercial vessel traffic associated with the port of Newport, OR, vessel operations are not likely to cause biologically significant effects to any of the ESA-listed species. Presence of SWIFT Drifters The SWIFT drifters used in cooperative target testing are inert objects that drift with the dominant winds, wave, or current. As these will be deployed for short drifts through the project area, no biologically significant effects are likely. Summary ESA-listed species (Section 3) may come into proximity with the autonomous iAMP or surface vessels during testing. If an ESA-listed species were present in the project area, the species’ movements or foraging could be temporarily disrupted by project activities such as vessel activity during iAMP deployment/recovery or cooperative target testing. Based on the analysis presented in this document, such effects would be insignificant and discountable at the individual and population level. Thus, the project would have no effect on threatened or endangered species.\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nAnnex 1 Best Management Practices (BMPs) for General In-Water Work Including Boat and Diver Operations The following BMPSs are intended to reduce potential adverse effects on protected marine species. These BMPs are in no way intended to supersede or replace measures required by any other agency including, but not limited to the ACOE, USFWS, USEPA, or NMFS. Compliance with these BMPs is secondary to safety concerns. A. Constant vigilance shall be kept for the presence of ESA-listed marine species during all aspects of the proposed action, particularly in-water activities such as boat operations, diving, and deployment of anchors and mooring lines. The project manager shall designate an appropriate number of competent observers to survey the marine areas adjacent to the proposed action for ESA-listed marine species. Surveys shall be made prior to the start of work each day, and prior to resumption of work following any break of more than one half hour. Periodic additional surveys throughout the work day are strongly recommended. All in-water work shall be postponed or halted when ESA-listed marine species are within 50 yards of the proposed work, and shall only begin/resume after the animals have voluntarily departed the area. If ESA-listed marine species are noticed within 50 yards after work has already begun, that work may continue only if, in the best judgment of the project supervisor, that there is no way for the activity to adversely affect the animal(s). For example; divers performing surveys or underwater work would likely be permissible, whereas operation of heavy equipment is likely not. When piloting vessels, vessel operators shall alter course to remain at least 100 yards from whales, and at least 50 yards from other marine mammals and sea turtles. Reduce vessel speed to 10 knots or less when piloting vessels at or within the ranges described above from marine mammals and sea turtles. Operators shall be particularly vigilant to watch for turtles at or near the surface in areas of known or suspected turtle activity, and if practicable, reduce vessel speed to 5 knots or less. If despite efforts to maintain the distances and speeds described above, a marine mammal or turtle approaches the vessel, put the engine in neutral until the animal is at least 50 feet away, and then slowly move away to the prescribed distance. Marine mammals and sea turtles should not be encircled or trapped between multiple vessels or between vessels and the shore. Do not attempt to feed, touch, ride, or otherwise intentionally interact with any ESA-listed marine species.\n\n\nNo contamination of the marine environment should result from project-related activities. A contingency plan to control toxic materials is required. Appropriate materials to contain and clean potential spills will be stored at the work site, and be readily available. All project-related materials and equipment placed in the water will be free of pollutants. The project manager and heavy equipment operators will perform daily pre-work equipment inspections for cleanliness and leaks. All heavy equipment operations will be postponed or halted should a leak be detected, and will not proceed until the leak is repaired and equipment cleaned. Fueling of land-based vehicles and equipment should take place at least 50 feet away from the water, preferably over an impervious surface. Fueling of vessels should be done at approved fueling facilities. Turbidity and siltation from project-related work should be minimized and contained through the appropriate use of effective silt containment devices and the curtailment of work during adverse tidal and weather conditions. A plan will be developed to prevent debris and other wastes from entering or remaining in the marine environment during the project.\n\n\nProject\niAMP - Newport\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.1 - iAMP - Newport\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nOne of the key assumptions made for the pre-installation estimate of noise for a proposed tidal energy project in Admiralty Inlet (Polagye et al. 2011) is that sound would propagate uniformly in all radial directions (i.e., transmission loss depends only on distance from the source, not on heading). The goal of this project is to verify this assumption. Specifically, NNMREC would deploy, from a surface vessel, an ITC-1032 transducer capable of producing an omni-directional acoustic tone at 10 kHz with a source level of 120 dB re 1 μPa at 1m. The transducer calibration curve indicates that 120 dB transmission would require a voltage input of approximately 1 Vrms. A sinusoidal voltage at this frequency and intensity would be output by a signal generator. A power amplifier would be used to match the voltage output to transducer impedance. The transducer would broadcast the tone for 15 seconds out of every 30 seconds. This would allow for evaluation of changing ambient noise conditions throughout the experiment. The transducer would be deployed to a depth of 50 m (the proposed turbine hub height). The transducer depth would be monitored by an in-line pressure logger.\n\nSound would be recorded by three types of hydrophone platforms: cabled hydrophones connected to a drifting surface vessel, autonomous hydrophones on drifting buoys, and an autonomous hydrophone deployed on the seabed. Cabled hydrophone: a pair of Cetacean Research C54XRS hydrophones would be deployed in-line at depths of 40 m and 20 m and cabled back to a surface vessel. The hydrophone depths would be monitored by in-line pressure loggers. The vessel would drift during measurements with engines and generators off to minimize vessel-induced noise. The vessel would periodically restart its engines to re-position when it drifts outside of the survey area. Autonomous drifter: a Loggerhead DSG recording hydrophone would be deployed near the base of the drifter. In this configuration, the hydrophone element would be approximately 1 m below the sea surface. The spatial extent of the surveys would consist of a circle 2 km in radius – encompassing the pre-installation estimate for the acoustic footprint for a pair of OpenHydro turbines at maximum power output (estimated to be 1.3 km – Polagye et al. 2011). Sound propagation in the survey area would be assessed from the collected data on the basis of radial wedges, as shown conceptually in Figure 2. Wedges are defined by common sound propagation properties (e.g., transmission loss coefficient). In other words, the sound received within a particular wedge should be principally a function of distance to the source, rather than angular position. The angular separation between wedges depends on the degree of bathymetric variation. For example, to the southeast and northwest of the survey center, the bathymetry within the wedge varies slowly and sound propagation could be expected to be described in a uniform manner within the wedge. However, to the southwest, the bathymetry changes rapidly with angular position and many wedges may be required to resolve variations in sound propagation. The approach taken here is analogous to an “N by 2D” numerical acoustic model and data would be collected in such a way as to facilitate a future comparison with model results. If Southern Resident killer whales are reported to be present in Admiralty Inlet (as informed by local observed networks), testing would be discontinued until the whales transit 5 km beyond the Project area.\nThe resulting information would serve to interpret acoustic measurements obtained after the installation of the turbines (not part of this proposed Project). Specifically, while the lower frequencies generated by the turbine would almost certainly result in complex, three-dimensional variations in received levels, noise would also be generated in the 1-3 kHz range. It is reasonable to expect that the conclusions about acoustic transmission at 10 kHz may be extended to sounds in the 1-3 kHz range. If the radial variations in received levels of turbine noise in these bands are well-aligned with the results from the source test, then this would suggest that a turbine acts as an omni-directional source. To the extent different patterns emerge, these may stem from source directivity. Accurate assumptions regarding source directivity and propagation directivity are essential for making accurate pre-installation estimates of received levels of turbine noise for other projects.\n\nProject\nSnoPUD - WA\nDocument\nSnoPUD Biological Eval_6.2011v3\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The development and testing of the near-turbine monitoring system would proceed through four phases. Phase 1: Dockside testing to evaluate the functionality of the system and calibrate the stereo cameras Phase 2: Fresh water testing to evaluate system performance in a low-light environment and verify the practicality of deploying the test mooring. Phase 3: Salt water testing in an area with weak tidal currents to evaluate system performance in a low-light environment with biological detritus slowly drifting around the camera.

    "text": "Excerpt\n\n\nTwo types of passive acoustic monitoring tools would be tested under this proposed Project: 1) click detectors and 2) broadband hydrophones.\nClick detectors are passive hydrophones that continually monitor ambient noise and, through software algorithms, identify potential click trains from echolocating cetaceans. Because some species of cetaceans (e.g., harbor porpoise) echolocate at frequencies as high as 130 kHz, a real-time click detector is considerably more efficient in terms of data transfer bandwidth than recording all acoustic data and identifying click trains as a post-processing step. The proposed Project would benchmark the performance of a new click detector designed for cabled operation (Chelonia FPod) against an existing unit designed for stand-alone operation (Chelonia CPod). During testing, both click detectors would be lowered over the side of a drifting research vessel. Drifts would take place in Admiralty Inlet during evening or early morning hours at a time when pre-installation studies have identified relatively high porpoise echolocation activity. Diel echolocation patterns from previous studies in this area, using bottom-mounted CPods, are shown in Figure 9. The metric for comparison between instruments would be Detection Positive Minutes (DPM). Two CPods and two FPods would be simultaneously deployed to also assess variability in detection sensitivity between instruments of the same class (i.e., between a pair of FPods or a pair of CPods). Unlike click detectors, broadband hydrophones continually monitor ambient noise and either store this data internally or stream it back to a data logger by a cable. The proposed Project would involve testing a broadband hydrophone that has not previously been used by NNMREC. Tests would be conducted dockside from Port Townsend, Washington and from a drifting research vessel in Admiralty Inlet. Data would be collected when vessels are present in Admiralty Inlet and when they are not and the acoustic spectra compared to previous hydrophone measurements.\n\nProject\nSnoPUD - WA\nDocument\nSnoPUD Biological Eval_6.2011v3\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\n4.1 Sound Propagation Test\n\nEnvironmental stresses associated with the sound propagation test include: The 10 kHz tone, with a source level of 120 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m, The mooring to hold the research vessel deploying the acoustic source on station, and The presence of two research vessels in northern Admiralty Inlet for the duration of the test.\nHastings and Popper (2005) divide fish species into hearing specialists and hearing generalists. Based on studies to date, specialists are able to perceive sounds up to 4 kHz, while generalists are only able to perceive sounds up to 1.5 kHz. Since a 10 kHz tone would be used for the sound propagation test, none of the fish species present in the proposed Project area would be expected to perceive the sound. Therefore, no behavioral effects are likely to occur. Marine mammal hearing is sensitive to a wider range of frequencies (Southall et al. 2007) and the tone is within the functional hearing range of humpback whales, Southern Resident killer whales, and Stellar sea lions. The intensity of the tone (rms source level of 120 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m) is, however, at the threshold established by NMFS for behavioral disturbance (120 dB re 1 μPa). Consequently, while marine mammals in the Project area may be able to detect the acoustic tone, it is unlikely to have any behavioral effect. Further, testing would be discontinued if Southern Resident killer whales are reported in Admiralty Inlet by local observer networks and not resumed until they are at least 5 km away from the Project area. Maximum sensitivity to avian species for airborne sound is between 1 and 5 kHz (Dooling 1982), so it is possible that the acoustic source will be audible to a diving marbled murrelet. USFWS guidelines for estimating significant behavioral disturbances due to underwater noise are 150 dB re 1µPa rms (USFWS 2006). Because the intensity of the tone (rms source level of 120 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m) is below this threshold, no behavioral disturbance due to noise would be expected.\nMeasurements of background noise in Admiralty Inlet (Bassett 2010) show that broadband rms sound pressure levels exceed the 120 dB behavioral disturbance threshold for marine mammals nearly 50% of the time, as shown in Figure 11. This is attributed to the high density of vessel traffic in Admiralty Inlet from commercial shipping and passenger ferries. The acoustic source would be deployed from a research vessel (R/V Inferno) for the duration of the propagation test (no more than 12 hours in total). To hold the research vessel on station, a temporary mooring would be deployed in the Project area. This would consist of a stack of two railroad wheels, ~ 1 m in diameter and weighing 900 kg. These would be deployed from another research vessel with a high lifting capacity crane (R/V Jack Robertson) and recovered at the conclusion of the sound propagation test. When deployed, the mooring would rest on the seabed, disturbing 0.8 m2 within the Project area. Benthic habitat surveys (Snohomish PUD 2011) describe the seabed in the Project area as relatively uniform, composed predominantly of cobbles (6-26 cm characteristic size), pebbles (3-6 cm), and small boulders (26-40 cm). These cobbles are colonized by barnacles, algae, and anemones. The short-term disturbance from the mooring is unlikely to have any lasting effect on critical habitat for ESA-listed species. The mooring line from the anchor to research vessel deploying the source would be in tension throughout the sound propagation test due to the strength of the tidal currents in the Project area. Consequently, the only potential risk to ESA-listed species is collision with the taut line, which would be unlikely to cause serious injury.\nAs previously mentioned, vessel traffic levels in Admiralty Inlet are relatively high. A passenger ferry makes 20 crossing per day seven days each week, between Port Townsend and Keystone Harbor and all cargo vessels bound for the ports of Everett, Tacoma, and Seattle must pass through Admiralty Inlet. Tugs, barges, tankers, fishing vessels, military traffic, and cruise vessels also intermittently pass in close proximity to the Project area. Vessel density statistics derived from analysis of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are shown in Figure 12. In this context, the presence of two additional research vessels (one holding station on a mooring, the other primarily conducting drift surveys with engines and generators turned off) is unlikely to have any incremental effect on ESA-listed species. In summary, the sound propagation test is unlikely to have any effect on ESA-listed species, but may be detected by marine mammals in the Project area and would disturb a small area of the seabed (&lt; 1 m2). Testing effects are summarized in Table 2.\n\nProject\nSnoPUD - WA\nDocument\nSnoPUD Biological Eval_6.2011v3\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\n4.2 Near-turbine Monitoring System Development and Testing\n\nEnvironmental stresses associated with near-turbine monitoring system testing include: Artificial illumination for the stereo cameras; Sound from the acoustic camera; and The presence of research vessels for the duration of testing in Lake Washington and Admiralty Inlet.\nIn deep water or during nighttime hours, ambient illumination is insufficient to observe aquatic species with visual-spectrum cameras. Consequently, full-spectrum strobe illumination would be required to operate the system during the observation of a hydrokinetic tidal turbine (not part of the proposed action). The effect of artificial illumination varies with species and depth. For example, artificial light has been shown to result in attraction behavior by some surface species (Marchesan et al. 2005), while it has been shown to result in avoidance behavior in relatively deep water (e.g., deeper than 1000 m, Raymond and Widder 2007). The response to light in water between 50 and 60 m would likely vary by species and an opportunistic assessment of this effect is one objective of the Proposed Action. During testing, the camera and strobes would be oriented in a downward-looking direction, towards the seabed or lakebed. The extent of artificial illumination would, therefore, be roughly hemispherical, with a diameter equal to the separation between the test frame and camera frame (2-6 m). Similar illumination systems are used for benthic habitat surveys (Shortis et al. 2007), to monitor the effectiveness of trawls (Wouldiams et al. 2010), and for ROV surveys to evaluate species presence and absence (Pacunksi et al. 2008).\nThe acoustic camera that would be used during testing is a BlueView P900-2250-45, operating at a frequency of 2.25 MHz. As previously discussed, this is outside of the functional hearing range of fish (Hastings and Popper 2005) and birds (Dooling 1982). While marine mammal hearing is more sensitive to higher frequencies, even cetaceans that are most sensitive to high frequency noise (e.g., harbor porpoises) have a functional hearing cut-off around 180 kHz. This is a well below the operating frequency of the acoustic camera. Consequently, the acoustic camera would not be audible to any ESA-listed species in the Project areas.\nPotential effects of the near-turbine monitoring system development and testing are further described by testing phase.\nThe testing of the near-field monitoring system may affect, but is unlikely to adversely affect, ESA-listed species. The primary effect would come from the artificial illumination for the stereo camera system, but the duration of testing is sufficiently short term that attraction or avoidance would be unlikely to be of biological significance. Further, one of the goals of testing is to better understand the effect that artificial light has on aquatic species near the seabed in the Project area and the role that this would play in interpreting the results of post-installation monitoring of a tidal turbine. Details about all tests are summarized in Table 3.\n\nProject\nSnoPUD - WA\nDocument\nSnoPUD Biological Eval_6.2011v3\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The AMP sensor payload for this deployment consists of an acoustic camera, multibeam camera, hydrophones, and cameras with strobe illumination. The AMP sensors will be operated as follows: All sensors will continually acquire data and transmit it to a control computer on the WEC. During this mode of operation, the strobes will not be illuminated. Every 15 minutes, 45 seconds of data will be archived to disk. If there is insufficient natural illumination, the strobes (either red or white) will be used to illuminate the camera field of view for 3 seconds. The red strobes are an experimental concept that are likely to be less perceptible to marine life, but will have a reduced operating range (Fitzpatrick et al. 2013). If a target of interest is automatically detected in the multibeam sonar or acoustic camera data streams (exceeding thresholds of size and intensity), the 45 seconds of data surrounding that detection will be archived to disk.

High-frequency hearing limits for coarse taxonomic groupings are: Fish: Fish, including sharks, are most sensitive to sound &lt; 1 kHz and are not generally sensitive to sound &gt; 10 kHz (Popper and Fay 2011, Hawkins et al. 2014). Marine Mammals: While marine mammal hearing is more sensitive to higher frequencies, even high-frequency specialists such as harbor porpoises are not sensitive to sound &gt; 200 kHz (Kastelein et al. 2002). The high-frequency hearing limits for pinnipeds, such as the Hawai’ian monk seal, and mid-frequency cetaceans, such as the false killer whale, are considerable lower than 200 kHz (Southall et al. 2007, NMFS 2016c). Birds: The maximum sensitivity to avian species for airborne sound is between 1 and 5 kHz (Dooling 1982). Sea Turtles: While sea turtle hearing has not been extensively characterized, Bartol and Ketten (2006) suggest that their high-frequency limit is less than 1 kHz. Consequently, all active acoustic sensors on the AMP operate at frequencies above fish, marine mammal, and sea turtle hearing and would not be audible. Light from Strobes Fish, marine mammals, sea turtles, and diving seabirds may exhibit temporary behavioral responses to artificial illumination. However, the duty cycle for artificial illumination is limited (a maximum of 3 seconds of illumination every 45 seconds in the event of continuous automatic target detection in the absence of sufficient ambient light) and of limited spatial extent (strobe illumination is unlikely to propagate more than 10 m). Consequently, any temporary behavioral response is unlikely to be biologically significant.

    "text": "Excerpt\nIntelligent Adaptable Monitoring Package The Intelligent Adaptable Monitoring Package (iAMP) is a refinement on the first generation Adaptable Monitoring Package (AMP). The distinction between the two is primarily one of instrument integration, with some modification to the supported sensors. Sensors on the AMP operate independently, while sensors on the iAMP are networked together in a way that will, through this project, allow one sensor to trigger another. This integrated approach is necessary to avoid an overwhelmingly large stream of data (much of which would contain no events of interest) while monitoring marine energy projects. The iAMP (Figure 2) is a streamlined body enclosing multiple oceanographic sensors. The iAMP is deployed to a docking station (Figure 3) by a customized ROV (Figure 4) launched from a surface vessel. The docking station is cabled back to a shore station and the iAMP plugs into a wet-mate connector on the docking station to access shore power and data. This can be can be considered as a “plug and socket” architecture where the docking station in the socket and the iAMP is the plug. When installed on the docking station, the iAMP would sit approximately 2 m above the seabed. During all vessel operations, the University of Washington would adhere to the attached Best Management Practices (Annex 1), including the transits to and from the survey areas in order to avoid or reduce impacts on protected marine species and their habitats, particularly as they pertain to protected species awareness and avoidance. If whales are sighted, vessel operators would adhere to the Guidelines for Operations when whales are sited, as summarized in Annex 2. The iAMP is equipped with the following oceanographic sensors: Stereo-optical cameras with strobe illuminators to freeze motion and provide artificial light in the absence of ambient light (Joslin et al. 2014) An acoustic camera (BlueView M900-2250) with an operating frequency of 2250 kHz A multibeam sonar (Kongsberg M3) with an operating frequency of 500 kHz A Doppler wave and current profiler (Nortek Signature 500) with an operating frequency of 500 kHz An array of four passive hydrophones (OceanSonics icListen HF) A passive fish tag receiver (Vemco VR2W) A passive echolocation click detector (Chelonia CPOD) During testing, instruments would be operated on either a fixed duty cycle or in a triggered mode (automatic or manual). Cooperative Targets While opportunistic presence of marine life (e.g., fish) is likely to occur during endurance testing, because the presence or absence of marine life will not be known to the research group, these represent “uncooperative targets” for the purposes of establishing the range and functionality of the iAMP instrumentation. For this reason, it is desirable to employ “cooperative targets” that are either under the control of the research group or freely drifting with a known position. The two cooperative targets that would be employed are the deployment ROV (the “Millennium” Falcon) and SWIFT drifters (Figure 5) Both systems would present a detectable target for active acoustic and optical sensors. In addition, calibration spheres (small targets with known acoustic backscatter properties) would be suspended from the SWIFT for quantitative benchmarking of the acoustic camera and multibeam sonar on the iAMP. The physical presence of the cooperative targets would be augmented by sounds of interest for marine energy monitoring, specifically a fish tag (Vemco V13, 69 kHz operating frequency, 150 dBrms re 1 μPa at 1 m, impulsive sound), such as have been used or proposed for use in studies of fish presence/absence at marine energy sites, and an acoustic projector (OceanSonics icTalk) configured to emit periodic porpoise click trains (120 kHz, 140 dBrms re 1 µPa at 1 m, impulsive sound). The position of the cooperative targets would be tracked by redundant GPS units, either in the SWIFT spar or on a surface-piercing mast for the ROV. ROV and SWIFT spars will be marked with orange flags (e.g., Figure 5) to provide a visual cue for other vessels in the area. A standby vessel will be on station at all times during cooperative target testing to minimize the risk of any vessel coming into contact with either the ROV or SWIFT.\nProject\niAMP - Sequim\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.7 - iAMP - Sequim\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Sound from Active Acoustics Sensors and Instruments All active acoustic sensors on the iAMP operate at frequencies above fish hearing and would not be audible. Fish are most sensitive to sound &lt; 1 kHz and are not generally sensitive to sound &gt; 10 kHz (Popper and Fay 2011, Hawkins et al. 2014). Similarly, the acoustic projector and fish tag both operate at frequencies &gt; 50 kHz. Consequently, these sounds will not affect aquatic species present in Portage Bay. Light from Strobes Light from the strobes will be intermittent, not to exceed 1 minute every 15 minutes during diagnostic testing in daylight hours (7% duty cycle) and 1 second every 15 minutes during duty-cycled operation in nighttime hours (&lt; 1% duty cycle). During daylight hours, operation of the strobe would not substantially increase light beyond ambient levels and would be unlikely to affect aquatic species. During nighttime hours, the effect of artificial illumination is likely to vary with species. For example, artificial light has been shown to result in attraction behavior by some surface species (Marchesan et al. 2005), while it has been shown to result in avoidance behavior in relatively deep water (Raymond and Widder 2007). The extent of artificial illumination would be roughly hemispherical with a range of &lt; 6 m (Joslin et al. 2014). Similar illumination systems are used for benthic habitat surveys (Shortis et al. 2007), to monitor the effectiveness of trawls (Williams et al. 2010), and for ROV surveys to evaluate species presence and absence (Pacunksi et al. 2008). Consequently, while the activation of the strobes may result in a temporary behavioral response for the duration of the illumination (1 second every 15 minutes) during nighttime periods, this is unlikely to be biologically significant. Presence of iAMP Hull Over the four-week testing period, the iAMP hull is unlikely to significantly foul in fresh water and, therefore, would not develop as an artificial reef, making fish attraction unlikely. Neither the presence of the iAMP hull in the water nor its removal at the conclusion of testing would cause any biologically effect.\nProject\niAMP - Sequim\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.7 - iAMP - Sequim\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nEndurance Testing Environmental stresses associated with endurance testing of the iAMP in Sequim Bay include: Emission of sound from active acoustic sensors and instruments (e.g., fish tag, acoustic projector) Emission of light from optical camera strobes Presence of the iAMP hull in the water and docking station/utility cable on the seabed Presence of the R/V Jack Robertson at the mouth of Sequim Bay during deployment and recovery operations, presence of the ROV and/or SWIFT drifter in the water during cooperative target testing, and presence of a small boat in the water for SWIFT drifter recovery during cooperative target testing The biological significance of these stresses is discussed sequentially in the same order as the bullet list. Stressor considerations applicable to dockside testing of the system are not repeated here. Sound from Active Acoustic Sensors and Instruments Marine Fishes As discussed under the effects of dockside testing, all active acoustic sensors on the iAMP and sources on cooperate targets operate at frequencies above fish hearing and would not be audible. Avian Species Maximum sensitivity to avian species for airborne sound is between 1 and 5 kHz (Dooling 1982), so it is unlikely that any of the active acoustics would be audible to a diving marbled murrelet for short-tailed albatross. Marine Mammals While marine mammal hearing is more sensitive to higher frequencies, the harbor seals present in Sequim Bay have a poor hearing above 100 kHz (Kastelein et al. 2009). This is below the operating frequency of the acoustic camera (2250 kHz), multibeam sonar (500 kHz), acoustic Doppler current profiler (500 kHz), and acoustic projector simulating porpoise click trains (120 kHz). Consequently, none of these instruments are likely to be audible to the harbor seals in the Project area. The operating frequency of the fish tags (69 kHz) is within the hearing range of the harbor seals present in Sequim Bay. Given that these sources will be deployed in a limited manner (up to eight hours on four occasions, with a signal repetition rate of no more than once per minute), no biologically significant behavioral response to the sound would be expected. The intensity of the impulsive sound transmitted by the fish tag is also below the statutory limit for acoustic harassment of marine mammals (150 dBrms re 1 µPa source level versus 160 dBrms re 1 µPa limit for Level B harassment). Light from Strobes Fish, marine mammals and diving seabirds may exhibit temporary behavioral responses to artificial illumination, but the restricted duty cycle for artificial illumination during nighttime periods means that this is unlikely to be biologically significant (a maximum of 1 second each minute once automated triggering algorithms are developed and a maximum of 1 second every 15 minutes during initial operation). Presence of iAMP Hull, Docking Station, and Utility Cable The iAMP would be deployed in Sequim Bay for up to 90 days over a fourth month period. While the deployment window (August 1 – November 30) is outside the period of most intense biological fouling, some colonization of the hard structures is to be expected. Fish may make use of the current “shadow” downstream of the iAMP as an area of refuge from strong currents, but biologically significant reef effects within critical habitat would not be expected. Installation of the docking station and shore cable will disturb less than 2 m3 of seabed (&lt; 1 m3 for the docking station feet and &lt; 1 m3 for the cable, including screw anchors as a preventative measure to secure the cable against the currents). Any disturbance to colonized substrate (e.g., sponges, barnacles, anemones) would be minimal. Consequently, the presence of the system for a short-term test is unlikely to have biologically significant effects. No eelgrass or other submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is located in the area proposed for docking station deployment or cable routing to the MSL dock. Presence of Vessels Installation and recovery of the iAMP will involve operations from the R/V Jack Robertson, a 60’ research vessel equipped with an A-frame and deck crane. The Robertson would be present on two occasions for less than 12 hours in each instance for initial iAMP deployment and final iAMP recovery. If intermediate maintenance is required, the Robertson would need to be on station for recovery and redeployment, each of which is approximately a 30 minute operation. During cooperative target testing, a combination of small boat activity, SWIFT drifts, and ROV operations would be anticipated over an eight hour window on up to four occasions. Given the limited duration of these activities and similarity to the recreational boat traffic common in Sequim Bay, vessel operations are not likely to cause biologically significant effects to any of the ESA-listed species identified in Section 3.2. Summary ESA-listed fish species (Section 3) may come into proximity with the iAMP or surface vessels during testing. If an ESA-listed fish species were present in the Project area, the species’ movements or foraging could be temporarily disrupted by project activities such as vessel activity during iAMP deployment/recovery or cooperative target testing. Based on the analysis presented in this document, such effects would be insignificant and discountable at the individual and population level. Further, nearshore areas do not have characteristics that make them essential to conservation of the threatened or endangered fish. Thus, the project is unlikely to have any effect on threatened or endangered fish species. Murrelets foraging in deeper water may be temporarily disturbed by vessel traffic in the narrow channel during iAMP deployment/recovery and cooperative target testing. This could result in minor energy expenditures and lost foraging opportunities, but not at a level that would be biologically significant. Thus, the project is unlikely to have any effect on the marbled murrelet. The dock station and cable to the dock would be deployed in critical habitat. However, the total affected area of substrate would be less than two square meters. Thus, the scale of effect on critical habitat is discountable.\nProject\niAMP - Sequim\nDocument\nBiological Evaluation REV 1.7 - iAMP - Sequim\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.
