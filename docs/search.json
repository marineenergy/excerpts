    "text": "Excerpt\nAll of these species can sense sounds in the frequency range of the sound produced by the hydraulic drills. Sound levels typically decrease by ~40 dB at 100 m in water, i.e., a sound measured at 160 dB re 1 uPa at a distance of 1 m from the source will measure ~120 dB re 1 uPa 100 m away from the source. This is below the level that appears to affect any of the species listed here. Smith (2002) observed during construction activities involving drilling similar to those for the WET installation that marine life, turtles and fish in particular, were attracted to the activity, possibly by the bottom biota stirred up by the drilling. This suggests that the magnitude of the sound produced by the drills is not sufficient to alter behaviors of the species near the activity. Because of the short and intermittent nature of the noise produced by the drills during the construction phase of the project, it is unlikely that the noise will significantly disrupt feeding or other behaviors of these species. The noise produced by drilling during the construction phase of the project is localized, intermittent and of short duration. Although the species of interest for this assessment can sense sound of the magnitude and frequency content produced by the drills similar to those expected to be used for the installation operations, neither the amplitude nor the frequencies are sufficient to constitute an impact on the species. No mitigation measures are required during the construction and installation phases of the project.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003 – APPENDIX F: Wave Energy Technology (WET) Project Environmental Impacts of Selected Components.

In general, the workboats would be stationary or operate within a small area (e.g., during anchor mooring installation) or move methodically along a prescribed path (i.e., during the cable laying operation).

    "text": "Excerpt\nDuring operation, there is a potential for the WEC devices to experience an electrical fault or short due to damage to the transmission cables. In the event of an electrical fault, there is a short period of time during which the electrical current generated by the WEC system would leak to seawater. A computer-controlled fault detection and interruption system would divert the electric current from the cable and store it in load resistors in the event of a fault. Therefore, the Proposed Action is unlikely to significantly impact marine mammals due to electrical leakage during operation and maintenance activities. Decommissioning activities would not produce electrical leakage risks as there would be no electrical current running through the cables. Electroreception (i.e., the sensing of electric fields by organisms) is not found generally among mammals, including those that are most likely to be present in the project area. There is conflicting evidence for magnetoreception (i.e., the sensing of magnetic fields by organisms) or use of the Earth’s magnetic field in marine mammals (Klinowska 1985, 1988; Hui 1994; Brabyn and Frew 1994). But any evidence of marine mammals using geomagnetic information suggests that the information would be used at the landscape level instead of the bathymetric micro-feature level. Therefore, it is unlikely that electric or magnetic fields generated by the proposed subsea transmission cables during the operations and maintenance activities would significantly impact marine mammals.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nFrom the available information, it is impossible to confidently predict the magnetic emissions impact from the WEC undersea cable on the nearshore biota but it is likely that elasmobranchs, sea turtles and cetaceans can sense the cable’s magnetic field. There is little information regarding the threshold levels of sensitivity for these species. Based on background geomagnetic levels and the ability of several species to track geomagnetic features, their sensitivity is likely to be significant. Thus, there are four behavioral scenarios of impact assuming magnetic detection of the cables: 1) detection and no effect, 2) detection and confusion, 3) detection and avoidance or 4) attraction. The best means of mitigating the impacts of an electrical fault are to prevent it from happening. The strength of the WEC undersea power cable and its armored construction provide the first level of mitigation. If there is a fault, the computer-controlled electrical fault detection and circuit interruption system shunts the electrical current to the load resistors in from 6 to 20 ms, limiting the duration of the electrical field created by a fault.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003 – APPENDIX F: Wave Energy Technology (WET) Project Environmental Impacts of Selected Components.

Although the WEC cable is in contact with the seafloor, the thermal resistance of the sediments or other seafloor material is substantially higher than that of the seawater. Hence, the heat transferred directly into the seabed materials would be negligible. Heat released from the equipment canister, load resistors, and hydraulic fluid heat exchanger into the surrounding water is anticipated to be similar in nature to heat released from the undersea cable. The resulting temperature increase for a single buoy would be approximately 0.07 F (0.02 C).

Guidance for human diver exposure to underwater sound indicates that, in the 100 to 500 Hz frequency range, recreational divers (i.e., bareheaded) and swimmers should not be exposed to SPLs greater than 145 dB re 1 uPa (Parvin et al 2002). In the 501 to 2500 Hz frequency range, the same guidance recommends that recreational divers and swimmers should not be exposed to SPLs greater than 155 dB re 1 uPa. the construction period hand drilling associated with anchoring the subsea cables would be brief and temporary (i.e., approximately one week) and because the drill-related sound (i.e., assumed in the analysis to be 163 dB re 1 uPa at the source) would be attenuated to the lower guidance level approximately 50 ft (16 m) from the drilling, the construction related underwater noise is not expected to increase risk to humans in nearshore waters. Furthermore, according to MCB Hawaii Base Order P1710.1, all persons and watercraft are prohibited from recreational water sports and fishing within 500 yards of the shoreline in the approach areas at both ends of Runway 4-22.

The template will have dimensions similar to the bottom support frame and will be removed at the completion of foundation installation. The temporary increase in vessel traffic and associated mooring systems are expected to be minor and are consistent with activities already occurring in the area.

    "text": "Excerpt\nLaying the power cables on the sea floor, divers working to position and secure the cables, and anchors used by support vessels all have the potential to directly strike coral colonies should they be present when the equipment or divers contact the bottom. The severity of injury to the coral will depend largely on the size and hardness of the impacting object and the intensity of the impact. Injury could range from a small area of soft tissue damage that quickly heals to total obliteration of the colony. The project plan and BMPs require that divers be aware of the identity and status of the ESA proposed corals and to specifically watch for and avoid them completely during work to position and install the power cables, including anchoring support vessels. Based on the sparse distribution of these corals, the limited amount of work to be done where they occur, and the expectation that divers will comply with the BMPs, the Navy determined that the risk of direct impact on colonies of either species is discountable. During cable laying operations, diver and/or ROV assistance would be employed to avoid placement on ESA proposed listed corals. Installation of the WEC devices, mooring infrastructure, and scientific data gathering equipment would also avoid ESA proposed listed corals. During the operational period, there would be no collision hazard impacts to ESA proposed coral species from the operation or maintenance of the WEC devices, scientific data gathering equipment, and their associated infrastructure. Decommissioning activities would be coordinated with NOAA Fisheries to ensure the protection of ESA proposed listed coral.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nPower cables generate both electric and magnetic fields. The flow of seawater across the electric field of a power cable generates a weak magnetic field. Potential electric and magnetic fields surrounding the WEC undersea cable have been calculated for a range of electrical currents through the cable. Based on the anticipated current passing through the WEC cable, the electric field strength at the surface of the cable would range from approximately 1.5 to a maximum of 10.5 millivolts per meter (mV/m) and would decrease exponentially with distance from the cable. The magnetic field strength at the surface of the cable would range from approximately 0.1 amperes (amps [A]) per meter (A/m) to a maximum of 0.8 A/m and would decrease exponentially with distance from the cable. Organisms sensitive to magnetic fields may exhibit one of three behaviors: (1) detection and no effect, (2) detection and confusion or avoidance, or (3) attraction. Based on the available data as described in Chapter 4 and cited in Appendix F, impacts of electric and magnetic fields on marine organisms can be expected to range from no impact to avoidance of the vicinity of the WEC cable. Organisms sensitive to electric or magnetic fields may detect emissions near the WEC cable; however, the effects would be temporary. Since the cable occupies a small area of the seafloor, the impact of avoidance behavior would be minimal. The cable route would not occupy any unique feeding, breeding, birthing, or egg-laying areas. The analysis provided in Appendix F found no evidence in the literature of either short- or long-term effects of electric or magnetic fields from cables similar to the WEC cable on marine organisms, other than the possible behaviors described. Although there have been numerous inconclusive studies of the effects of electromagnetic fields on animals in air, no similar studies have been found of the effects of EMF on marine animals in seawater. During operation, the WEC system could possibly experience an electrical fault or short due to damage to the cable. In the event of an electrical fault, there is a short period of time during which the electrical current generated by the WEC system would leak to seawater. However, the computer-controlled electrical fault detection and circuit interruption system would shunt the electrical current to the load resistors within 6 to 20 milliseconds (ms), limiting the duration of the electrical field.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThe AMP is based on fish monitoring that was conducted in 2014 after the sockeye salmon smolt outmigration. During fish monitoring the largest school of fish detected in one observation was 100 fish and this was not during the sockeye smolt outmigration period. As the plan discusses, up to 20,000,000 outmigrating sockeye smolt could pass the RivGen in a single day during this concentrated period of outmigration and about 50,000,000 in the major two-week pulse of sockeye smolt outmigration at the project site. Project studies and reports do not consider the potential effects of fish alarm pheromones which can occur when the skin of even a single fish is injured and will release a fish alarm pheromone which is very quickly dispersed through the water causing a predator response in all other fish in a school. In salmonids, this results in fish sounding, i.e., they stop swimming and drop quickly to the bottom, which could result in a very large number of fish going through the turbines (Magurran, Irving and Henderson 1996; Sovava et al 2014; and Scott et al 2003). Video observations of a school of 100 fish cannot adequately inform the behavior of 20,000,000 fish in the same space and time.\nProject\nIgiugig\nDocument\nIgiugig Hydrokinetic Project NMFS Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Recommendations FERC Project No. 13511\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

In fact, as validated by the observation of the high rate of colonization of a discarded amphibious vehicle track, the anchor array will likely result in an overall increase in biotic composition and abundance in the areas where the anchoring system is situated. The anchor design should minimize or eliminate any movement of the anchor that could result in breakage of some of the corals and small ledges observed in the anchoring zone.

Trollers will motor near the buoys as they do the FADs and bottom fishers will either drift near the buoys, anchor near them, or tie off on them. The anchoring depth of the buoys at approximately 100 feet (30.5meters) is a diveable depth for most experienced scuba divers, especially commercial divers. They will dive primarily to spear the shallow water species around the anchoring systems, but may also use underwater surround nets and traps. Blue water divers are a unique subset of spear fishers who use high-powered spear guns at the State s FADs. They float in the water near the FADs and try to spear large pelagic game fish such as a’u (marlin), ahi (yellowfin tuna), and mahimahi (dolphin) that are attracted to the FADs. Blue water divers will also be attracted to the WEC buoys. The buoy cluster will be of interest to recreational scuba divers who will regard them as a unique dive site such as a cave dive or a wreck dive. They will want to dive on them just to see the buoys and observe them in action.

The pontoons are 4.6 feet in diameter, which represents a very small portion of the overall cross section of the river in the project area, and would not lead to a major increase of water speed. We expect scour around the project pontoons to be negligible. In addition, available information indicates that the majority of the riverbed is composed of coarse gravel, cobbles, and small to medium boulders, all of which require high river velocity for mobilization and are less prone to scour. The gravel, cobble, and boulders would also act as scour protection for any smaller sediment classes that may lie underneath.\nProject\nIgiugig\nDocument\nIgiugig Hydrokinetic Project Final License Application Environmental Assessment FERC Project No. 13511-003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The cable would cross an area of reef with sparse coral cover. The footprint of the cable will be approximately 12 in (30 cm) wide. Using diver assistance for portions of the cable route in waters up to 100 ft (30 m) deep and a cable route determined using ROV video surveys interpreted by marine biological experts for deeper waters, adjustments while laying the cables would allow for the footprint to be shifted away from any important invertebrate resources, such as coral colonies, to further avoid and minimize impacts. There may be adverse impact from diver presence while laying and securing the cable. Sand may be kicked up, or a coral colony accidentally damaged by a diver assisting the installation. Although the Proposed Action may have an unavoidable adverse effect to some coral colonies during construction, the overall impact will be minimal. The Proposed Action is expected to have minimal to no impact to other marine invertebrate communities, as the sandy substrate in the deep- water WETS berth area does not support a rich sessile invertebrate community.

Throughout 2006-2008, as discussed above, Verdant Power logged approximately 290 hours of bird observations before and during deployment of the RITE Demonstration Project KHPS units. Birds were observed around the demonstration project to determine if the KHPS units adversely impact diving birds associated with the East River; Verdant Power believes that the body of developed knowledge does not show any signs of impact on diving birds. This detailed effort in and around the RITE project demonstration site and the general area of the proposed RITE Pilot License did not show any material difference in pre-and post-operation bird activity. The presence of more geese flying through the area in post-deployment during the fall of 2008 can be attributed to seasonal migration patterns. Observations during the operation of the RITE Demonstration KHPS units also did not indicate any increased attraction of diving birds to the site which may have been expected if the turbines impacted fish in the area. Anecdotal evidence suggests double-crested cormorants, the only diving birds observed at the site, swim/float with the current and only dive during or close to slack tide when the turbines are not rotating.\nProject\nRITE\nDocument\nRITE Final License Application FERC Project No. 12611, Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The species that could occur in the project area are species that are relatively insensitive to noise (i.e. humpback whales, bottlenose dolphins, and spinner dolphins). The rock drill will be used in the presence of people and operating equipment and vessels. The physical cues of people and equipment are likely to discourage marine mammals from approaching the drill closely. The rock drills would be used for short, punctuated periods of time–several minutes at a time–instead for a sustained period of time. Furthermore, protective zones would be implemented during drilling operations to ensure that no harassment occurs to marine mammals (see BMPs listed in Section 2.2.4 and below). Rock drilling operations would not commence if a marine mammal is sighted within 1,640 ft (500 m) of the drilling site. If a marine mammal enters the zone after drilling has started, operations would cease if the animal approaches within 820 ft (250 m) of the drilling site (i.e., outside the estimated 120 dB re 1 Pa isopleth of 141 m described in previous paragraph).\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

The cables would be secured to the seafloor in water depths less than 100 ft (30 m), to avoid movement due to the high energy wave and surf zone. Beyond 100 ft (30 m), the lower wave energy at the seafloor and weight of the cables would keep them relatively stationary. Based on marine surveys conducted between the installation of the shallow-water WET berth transmission cable in 2003 and 2011, there was no evidence that any portion of the existing transmission cable had moved since being installed in 2003 and no evidence that any corals had been damaged due to movement of the cable (see discussion in Section 3.7.3). Therefore, the same is expected for the Proposed Action’s subsea cables in corresponding water depths and habitat zones.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS Environmental Assessment 2014\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

This determination is based on analyses of (1) wave height reduction due to wave scattering and (2) wave height reduction due to energy absorption. Using a numerical solution to evaluate wave scattering caused by a wave passing through an infinite grating of circular cylinders, results indicate that the effects of six WEC buoys on wave transmission and reflection would be negligible. This is due to the relatively large design spacing between the buoy cylinders, 169 ft (51.5 m), as compared to the buoy diameter of 15 ft (4.5 m). Potential effects on wave heights due to energy absorption were analyzed by running a wave refraction-diffraction model. Results estimated that wave heights near the shoreline would be reduced by 0.5 percent for a wave period of 9 s, and less than 0.3 percent for a period of 15 s. The impact of six WEC buoys on a wave field would be minimal and would not be noticeable or quantifiable given the randomness of the wave action.\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

During high wave activity, a WEC device might have a SPL of up to 151 dB re: 1 uPa at 1 m, but the sound will occur amidst ambient wave noise, which will mask the sound to some degree. For a WEC device that has a SPL of 151 dB re 1 uPa at 1 m, the 120 dB re 1 uPa isopleth would lie at 115 ft (35 m) from the source, using spherical spreading loss. Under conditions of high ambient noise, the WEC device may be difficult to detect acoustically at distances greater than the 120 dB isopleth. Any behavioral disturbance, such as avoidance of the area, would occur at less than 115 ft (35 m) from the device. Due to the nature of the sound, its similarity to light vessel traffic, and its association with wave noise, exposed animals are expected to habituate to the sound which would make any behavioral modification or avoidance temporary.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThree components of the Reedsport Project represent sources of EMF: the PowerBuoys, the USP, and the subsea transmission cable. In conclusion, the Faraday cages of the PowerBuoy and USP and the metallic sheathing and burying of the project subsea cables will significantly reduce or eliminate E fields from being emitted into the surrounding aquatic environment. Magnetic (B) fields cannot be shielded, and the flow of seawater or organisms through a B field creates a weak electric field (iE field). OPT\n\nhas found no evidence to indicate that magnetic fields negatively affect marine life (Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies 2005; Scott Wilson Ltd. and Downie 2003; Sound & Sea 2002; USACE 2004; Scottish Executive 2007; World Health Organization 2005). However, resource agency staff are concerned that the project differs from traditional sources of anthropogenic EMF in the ocean (underwater power cables). Specifically, agency staff note that instead of a single cable lying on or under the seabed, the proposed project represents 10 PowerBuoys and associated cables running through the entire water column, as well as the multiple cables running along the seabed, converging on the USP. Therefore, instead of a single linear source of EMF, as represented by the subsea cable running from the USP to shore, the proposed project represents a matrix of cables and PowerBuoys spanning the water column and converging on the seabed in the PowerBuoy array area. Resource agencies believe that the potential effects of this unique EMF-generating array should be evaluated in situ and potential effects to identified marine life examined. OPT believes that the proposed EMF Study Plan will allow for the collection of necessary information to evaluate the B fields generated by the project and to confirm that the corresponding E fields are negligible, as anticipated. Comparison of the recorded EMF levels to known thresholds for sensitive species will allow for a determination of potential effects, if any, of EMF emitted by the project. Where threshold levels are not available in the literature for species of concern or other surrogates, the Aquatic Resources and Water Quality Committee will be convened to determine appropriate steps through the AMP to understand the effects of the EMF on these species. Also, as part of the Fish and Invertebrates Study, OPT will evaluate if the project affects the local (scale: tens of meters) distribution and abundance of adult Dungeness crab (Appendix C).\n\nProject\nOPT Reedsport\nDocument\nOPT Reedsport Wave Park FERC Project No. 12713 Applicant Prepared Environmental Assessment\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Historically, problems with entanglement were due primarily to the lack of technology available to precisely place and secure a cable or control the amount of tension. This resulted in spanning or bridging of the cable, and loops developing over time. In contrast to the these early systems, the WEC undersea cable would have the following characteristics: Installation would occur in shallow water (i.e., depths to approximately 100 ft [30.5 m]). Installation would occur with adequate tension to allow the cable to contour to the seafloor without suspensions or forming loops. Divers would inspect the cable route once it is placed. The length of the cable is relatively short compared to trans-oceanic undersea cables, about 3,900 ft (1,190 m).\nProject\nWETS\nDocument\nWETS EA JANUARY 2003\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☐ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nFALSE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☑ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

Because both turbine noise and ambient noise vary in time, the description is probabilistic. The time distribution of turbine noise is derived from measurements of a similar tidal turbine and convolved with the time distribution of ambient noise in the proposed project area. Results suggest that characterizing turbine noise and studying marine mammal responsiveness at this location will be challenging due to existing ambient noise associated with high vessel traffic density and sediment transport.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThe TidGenTM Power System is not expected to cause adverse effects on Atlantic salmon or Atlantic sturgeon (or shortnose sturgeon), and are expected to result in less noise than many current activities that take place in the vicinity of the Project, such as bottom trawling. ORPC believes the potential effects of underwater noise/vibration will have a negligible impact to Atlantic salmon during construction, operation, and removal given the brief exposure as salmon migrate through the project area. The noise levels associated with use of an impact hammer during construction pile driving activities may cause avoidance behavior. However, construction will be conducted outside the short migration window for Atlantic salmon smolts. As noted previously, Atlantic sturgeon have never been reported in Cobscook Bay so it is anticipated the given the short duration of the Project, expected noise levels near or below ambient levels (except for use of impact hammer) would not adversely affect Atlantic sturgeon in the extremely rare event they might occur in or near the Deployment Area.\nProject\nCobscook Bay\nDocument\nORPC Cobscook Bay FERC Pilot License Application – Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nORPC consequently concludes that the Project effects of the alteration of habitat will be negligible to these Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon, neither species of which are known to be attracted to in-water structures in the marine environment. While ORPC anticipates that adult and juvenile Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon will be able to detect and avoid the TidGenTM device, specifically the turbines, ORPC does not expect the Project will deter these species from otherwise using or transiting the habitat in an area where marine species are already exposed to a variety of commercial uses. The very limited number of adult Atlantic salmon returns and rapid migration through the Bay further minimize risk of effect to this species. ORPC will be conducting post-monitoring studies that can be used to more fully evaluate this potential affect. These include the proposed Benthic and Biofouling Monitoring Plan and the Fisheries and Marine Life Interaction Monitoring Plans (Appendix C of the Final Pilot License Application).\nProject\nCobscook Bay\nDocument\nORPC Cobscook Bay FERC Pilot License Application – Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☑ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nTRUE\n☑ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nTRUE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.

    "text": "Excerpt\nThe magnitude of the proposed projects for Western Passage/Harris Cove and Lower Cobscook Bay/Deep Cove are sufficiently small in scope that little impact to benthic habitats and their associated communities is anticipated. Such impacts will be predominantly temporary and of short duration, although longer-term (project duration) impacts or habitat losses may occur in the footprint area directly beneath the moorings. Benthic impacts in the turbine deployment areas will result almost entirely from habitat loss within the footprint of the moorings and, although this loss will continue as long as the moorings are deployed, the loss may be offset by the additional surface area afforded by the three-dimensional structure of the moorings; there may even be a net gain in benthic habitat. Additionally, the already limited habitat loss could be further minimized through design features of the base of the moorings that would allow flow beneath the mooring.\n\nBurial of the cable, regardless of method, will result in disturbance to the seafloor sediments and associated benthic communities, but such disturbance will be temporary and generally of very short duration. No threatened or endangered species were found during the survey, all organisms encountered being common and generally ubiquitous within the region, therefore, any small impacts to the benthic community resulting from specific aspects of the project, e.g. installation of moorings or burial of the cable, will likely be quickly mitigated through replacement or recruitment from the surrounding community.\nFinally, when the limited impacts anticipated with the proposed project are viewed in the context of the other surrounding activities, specifically commercial drag fishing and aquaculture, it is likely that the project-related impacts will be indiscernible from the impacts associated with these other activities.\n\nProject\nCobscook Bay\nDocument\nORPC Cobscook Bay FERC Pilot License Application – Exhibit E: Environmental Report\n☑ Ixn: Presented as potential interaction?\nTRUE\n☑ Obs: Described from observations at the project site?\nTRUE\n☐ MP: Monitoring Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ AMP: Adaptive Management Plan?\nFALSE\n☐ PME: Protection, mitigation, and ehnhancement?\nFALSE\n☐ BMP: Best Management Practices applied?\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Copyright © 2023.
